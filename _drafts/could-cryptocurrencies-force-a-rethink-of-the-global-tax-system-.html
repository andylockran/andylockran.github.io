<p>It's been one of the hot topics since Starbucks were criticised for failing to post what many perceived to be a 'fair tax receipt' based on profits generated in the UK.  More recently, Apple were lambasted by the EU, and the Irish government forced to open up an investigation, when it was made clear they'd only paid a fraction of what was expected from them since their move to Dublin.  </p>
<p>In the current world, a company may allocation profit to operating markets all over the world, enabling tax havens to be used to 'avoid' having to pay tax.  For a small business the operational costs of trying to get this setup are perceptively larger than the big boys.  Is it fair that there's one rule for the super rich and another for the rest of us?</p>
<p>Where cryptocurrency may disrupt this status quo is providing obfuscation as to where transactions actually take place, therefore under whose remit does the taxation of the transaction fall.  Whilst the large corporates may not have paid profits of their vast profits, at least 'til now they've happily handed over their VAT receipts and national insurance contributions from their employees.</p>
