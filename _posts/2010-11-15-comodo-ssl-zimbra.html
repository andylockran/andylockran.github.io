<p>I recently had to install a Comodo SSL certificate onto a Zimbra Server.  Unfortunately, if you already have a certificate there is no simple way of installing a SSL certificate that you've already purchased, hence the need for these instructions.</p>
<p>When you purchase a SSL cert from Comodo, you'll end up with three files:</p>
<li> $hostname.crt  = your cert file</li>
<li>$hostname.ca-bundle = the bundle file</li>
<li>$hostname.key (the key you produced and used to create the Signing Request).</li>
<p>Once you have these three files, copy the first to to your /tmp directory, and copy the key file to:</p>
<pre>/opt/zimbra/ssl/zimbra/commercial/commercial.key</pre>
<p>Once you've done that, you need to download an extra couple of certs from Comodo, depending on when you purchased your certificate.  I used the pre-March 2009 version, from here <a href="https://support.comodo.com/index.php?_m=downloads&_a=viewdownload&downloaditemid=12&nav=0,1,5"> Comodo Downloads</a>.</p>
<p>Once you've downloaded them, add them to the end of your ca-bundle file. </p>
<p>With that done, as root, run </p>
<pre>/opt/zimbra/bin/zmcertmgr verifycrtchain comm /tmp/$hostname.crt /tmp/$hostname.ca-bundle </pre>
<p>Providing that doesn't error out, then you're good to deploy.</p>
<pre>/opt/zimbra/bin/zmcertmgr deploycrt comm /tmp/$hostname.crt /tmp/$hostname.ca-bundle</pre>
<p>Switch to the Zimbra user:</p>
<pre>su - zimbra</pre>
<p>Then restart all zimbra services:</p>
<pre>zmcontrol restart</pre>
<p><em>Your new certificates are now installed!</em></p>
