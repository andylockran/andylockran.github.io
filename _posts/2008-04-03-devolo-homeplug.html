<p>Once in a while there is a fairly new and inventive solution to an old problem.</p>
<p>First we had networks.. then we had wireless networks.. and now we have wireless wired networks?</p>
<p>Ok, they're not technically wireless - but install of having a central wireless access point in the centre of your home, you can now buy the Devolo HomePlug - and have networking points wherever you have electricity.</p>
<p>You see, electricity flows through your power cables at a certain frequency.  The HomePlug sends your data through the wires at a different frequency.  It's quite simple really.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can but 14Mbps to 200+Mbps adapters for  the HomePlug - and it's n open standard, so you don't need to just buy from devolo.</p>
<p>They also have wireless plugs, so instead of the plug interfacing to a network connection on your PC/laptop - you can plug in a devolo wireless homeplug adapter and get a low-range wireless base in your house too.</p>
<p>However, they are pretty expensive ~Â£80 for 2.  They're also very addictive.  So much better than wifi that soon you'll be buying them for all you computers (like I did...)</p>
<p>Oh well.. the more we buy the more the price will start to drop.. right?</p>
<p>So BUY!!!</p>
