<p>Well I had some good news today at last whence I checked my email.  My credit card has been charged and I can expect to receive the neo by the end of the week.</p>
<p>The only issue is that it's due to be posted to Manchester, and I'm currently back down in Birmingham - so I'm hoping against hope that my flatmate will be in Manchester to collect it - and as my brother heads up there on Thursday, he will hopefully pop across and collect it to bring it back down to Birmingham before I head to France on Friday for a three week Vacation.  (I'm in Nottingham/Manchester all week with work).  Busy Bee...</p>
