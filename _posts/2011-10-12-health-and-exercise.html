<p>I've once again decided to try harder to get myself into shape, and as always with the help of peer pressure, I'm more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>I'm recording my eating and drinking habits <a title="Eating and Drinking" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlKY4PHKlIapdDRTQ1dJMlNTQm5hMExzRlFQWE14WXc&amp;hl=en_US#gid=2">here</a>Â - with a nice graph of my daily weight.</p>
<p>I'm also recording my exercise in that spreadsheet, but also on <a title="andylockran on Endomondo." href="http://www.endomondo.com/profile/116030" target="_blank">Endomondo</a>.</p>
<p>If there's anyone out there with any tips/suggestions, I'd be glad to hear them; please comment below.</p>
