<p>In the not too distant past, <a href="http://popey.com/No_Competition">I read this on Popey's blog</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Friends wife</strong>: <em>"Is that Firefox? Where have I heard of that?"</em><br /><strong>Me</strong>: (not wanting a conversation about geek stuff in the pub) <em>"It's a product which competes with one of Microsofts products."</em><br /><strong>Friends wife</strong>: <em>"Nah, we don't have any competitors."</em><br /><strong>Me</strong>: <em>"..."</em><br /><strong>Friends wife</strong>: <em>"Except maybe Google.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I thought it was quite amusing, and it's one of those things that really gets people's backs up in the Community.  However, less than a week later, I came across the same thing myself.  In my parent's Kitchen of all places.  One of my Mum's friends was round, and I was working in Birmingham for the day, so popped home to say hi.  I new her son worked 'In computers', and she's been quite knowledgeable in the past.<br />
<blockquote><strong>Mum's Friend:</strong> "So you work up in Manchester then Andy?"<br /><strong>Me:</strong> "Yeah, for a technology company"<br /><strong>Mum's Friend:</strong> "So what do you actually do?"<br /><strong>Me:</strong> "I develop Open Source Office Servers &amp; Solutions for SMEs - creating a more affordable system than Microsoft Exchange."<br /><strong>Mum's Friend:</strong> "Ooh, so is it a big company you work for?"<br /><strong>Me:</strong> "No, we have about 20 employees"<br /><strong>Mum's Friend:</strong> "So you're not really a competitor to Microsoft then... My Son works for Microsoft."</p></blockquote>
<p>What defines competitor.. someone who competes in the same market.  I've replaced MS Exchange Servers with Open Source Solutions.  If that's not competing, I don't know what is!</p>
