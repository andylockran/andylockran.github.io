<p>Well I've had quite a busy few days in getting some more work done on a few websites for friends.  I don't do anything commercially _yet_ - but one opportunity has reared its head and I will even be able to charge a fairly robust rate for the work - aswell as generating a monthly "support fee."</p>
<p>This being the case, how difficult/sensible would it be for me to set up my own company to handle this business.  I guess were it to be formed I'd also want to put some other work through it too.</p>
<p>Answers on a postcard please. (or below in the comments).</p>
