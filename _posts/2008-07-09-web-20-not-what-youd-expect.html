<p>Look, we're here.. the internet faces massive policing by stupid governments intent on limiting our freedom.<br />Should the ideas expressed in a recent blog (that software that is used on the internet be registered to a certified authority) go through.. it basically means good-bye to freedoms on the internet.</p>
<p>How easy would it be to create a new internet. Get back to 56K modems and telnetting between people to pass round information?Â  or would it simply be a massive 'encrypted net' - where legitimate and illegitimate activity get bundled together, hidden from prying eyes?</p>
<p><em><strong>Edit</strong></em> - as grifferz pointed out.. this makes little sense; I'll have to redress the issue in the future properly.</p>
