<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6993373.stm">BBC NEWS | Technology | Google backs private Moon landing</a></p>
<p>I know that this is far from my capability of completing, yet given that my blog sometimes appears quite high in the Google rankings I thought I'd send this post out for the as-yet-uninformed.</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I take it you may be interested in taking part in the aforementioned project for landing a robot on the moon.  Embedded electronics, mechanical engineering and comms experts will probably all be required in order to fulfil the aim of your project.  Though I am none of these myself - I have a proposal for you.</p>
<p>Choose FLOSS to power your computing?</p>
<p>Whilst you may be thinking "Hey - this is a competition for $20 million, not a playground project" choosing FLOSS is going to bring you many benefits.</p>
<p>If you want eyes on the code to make sure that everything you are doing is checked and double-checked - FLOSS communities can help.</p>
<p>If you want eyes on the software to let you know of any bugs/mis-calcuations you can make - FLOSS communities can help.</p>
<p>If you want to have massive (geek) public support for your project then FLOSS users can help.</p>
<p>If you want your project to be the start of something long-term that people will be able to benefit from for long after you complete the project (and hopefully win the prize) FLOSS can help.</p>
<p>If you want some machine operators on the day the rocket goes live, FLOSS can help.</p>
<p>If you want the latest and greatest - it's FLOSS.</p>
<p>I hope you understand what a big difference FLOSS can make to your project.  If you do choose to go to space, go to space with FLOSS.</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>
