<p>I did it.  Really pleased with my first half-marathon attempt coming home in a time of 1:45:07.  It was a lovely day, with pretty perfect conditions for the run.</p>
<p>Leaving the house at 6.45 was a bit of a challenge, as after a pretty heavy week at work I wasn't feeling the early start.  There was plenty of nervous energy to feed off though, so headed out without issue.</p>
<p>The run itself was nice and flat, if anything the only advice I'd give to the organisers would be to work out a way to 'clean up' the running surface over the first 1.5 miles.  It was a mixture of pavement kerbs and bollards that needed navigating, and with a few hundred people around it wasn't that easy to avoid turning an ankle or running into a knee-height stump.</p>
<p>That said, once the run began I decided to focus on my heart-rate.  Having not been able to put in quite the sufficient level of running that I'd hoped, I kept my heart rate under 180 for the first 5k.  Once I felt comfortable that I could keep that up, I realised that my times were hovering around 5:00/km.  I decided to switch and then set that as my target; keep just under 5:00 a kilometer and I'd be happy.</p>
<p>The screens on my garmin were setup with the second data screen showing three fields: heart rate; lap time and lap pace - set to auto lap on each KM.  I found this really useful as I wasn't targeting an overall time over the half-marathon distance, and instead could focus on keeping my pace steady and heart-rate sustainable.</p>
<p>I'd paced myself so that for the last 5k I'd consider lifting the pace, and think of it as another parkrun.  Turns out that's not the way to think of it - the last 2k were by far the hardest to push through.  My time slipped to 5:08/km on the penultimate, and I thought twice about trying to push myself harder to get back under 5:00 - I wanted to finish rather than worry about hitting any time targets.  The 22nd Kilometer then went past at another steady 5:08.</p>
<p>Representing the Clapham Chasers for the first time, (or at least wearing the trendy club singlet for the first time, to the amusement of my running buddies) I set my target as beating a runner from another club who was just ahead.  I threw myself past him and finished strongly, yet had another guy come bounding past the outside at double our pace.</p>

<p>It was a great experience, and a wonderful flat course to enjoy my first half.</p>
