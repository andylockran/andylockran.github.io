<p><em>*Disclaimer - this is a spoof article..<br /></em></p>
<p>When I first started using the internet I came across a site called <a href="http://www.enterprisemission.com" title="Enterprise Mission">www.enterprisemission.com</a>.  Despite being quite a reputable source for conspiracy theories, something always made me go back and look over the site.  I used to check it regularly as it had some good photos of the mars explorer mission back in '98 and some interesting takes on the millennium celebrations.  Luckily the world hasn't yet fallen into enemy hands (as predicted).</p>
<p>For some reason, unbeknown to me, I found myself back on the site this week.  It's changed from being a collection of articles to Richard C. Hoagland pushing as much merchandise as possible.  Whereas before you could read a nice article - now you can only get a nice DVD.  Progress. I scrolled down and found there was actually an article there I was able to read.  <a href="http://www.enterprisemission.com/sensor.htm" title="Sensors">This one.</a>  I'll summarise to save you having to go there.</p>
<p>The article covers the anomalous sensors in the Shuttle Fuel Tanks.  The big orange tanks contain supercooled hydrogen.  There are four sensors in the bottom of the tank that tell the tank to detach when the fuel gets below a certain level, to prevent it blowing up whilst still attached to the rocket.  NASA had noticed that regularly a sensor would fail - however, they'd also come back up randomly.  Despite literally millions of dollars of engineering checks, the same anomalous results still occured when the supercooled fuel was in the tank.</p>
<p>Richard C. Hoagland cited some ancient maths know as torsion physics to explain the situation.  Most of his work comes from applying ancient techniques.  This one is from Soviet Experiments. At least the fundamentals have roots there anyway.  However, this latest one is quite interesting.  I quote:<br />
<blockquote><font size="4">"""There is a REAL fifth force -- the so-called <em>"torsion field."</em></font></p>
<p><font size="4"> The theoretical foundation of this new science was laid          out by Einstein and Cartan over eighty years ago. In the original theory,          these fields were 'static,' meaning they could not move from point A to          point B -- only appearing as the basic 'spin forces' within the atom.          </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Other Relativity theoreticians later proposed the possible          existence of <em>dynamic </em>torsion fields -- meaning that these 'spin          forces' can <em><strong>propagate through space, </strong></em>creating          "action at a distance" effects. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Soviet laboratory experiments in the 1950s, conducted          by the <a href="http://www.divinecosmos.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=95&amp;Itemid=36">pioneering          scientist Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev,</a> found irrefutable <em>proof </em>of          these 'dynamic torsion fields' in action. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Kozyrev, and others after him, found that the "torsion          field" can indeed affect electrical phenomena under certain circumstances.          Electrical resistors can experience substantial changes in how conductive          they are, especially when made of denser metals such as tungsten. Quartz          crystal oscillators can have notable changes in their vibrational frequency.          Photocells demonstrate measurable discrepancies in how much 'work' they          can perform. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Electrical anomalies are a classic sign of torsion-field          interference, as can be routinely seen in the well over 10,000 published          scientific papers on the subject. This appears to be due to a unique coupling          of electromagnetic energy and torsion fields -- hidden away in Sir Edmund          Whittaker's original 200-plus "scalar potentials" before Heaviside          eviscerated them down to the four we now use. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Given this scientific background, when we see disruptions          in the electrical currents flowing through a platinum-based "ECO          sensor," buried at the bottom of a tank filled with super-cold liquid          hydrogen, we have to expand our investigation. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Here's the critical point: the shuttle's almost equally-cold          liquid OXYGEN tank "ECO sensors" have been TOTALLY UNAFFECTED          by "whatever" this recurring problem is!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">This indicates that it may be, in fact, some type of "torsion          phenomenon" -- uniquely associated with "ultra-cold, liquid          HYDROGEN."</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Super-cooled hydrogen is already known to mysteriously          crawl up the sides of a test-tube in a laboratory. This may be another anomaly explained by torsion-field activity. The utterly simplistic structure          of the hydrogen atom, with just one "proton" and one "electron"          -- plus the lack of molecular vibration (temperature) in a super-cooled          environment -- may present the perfect antenna or conduit for torsion          fields to move through."""</font></p></blockquote>
<p>Now surely if the Air Engineers can't work out which sensors caused the engine thrust to fail - and there's no proof.. it could be torsion physics to blame..</p>
<p>The thing that caught my attention was in a BBC article entitled "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7208126.stm" title="BBC Article">The Mystery of Flight BA0318</a>" where the journalist notes:<br />
<blockquote><font size="2">"But they will also be examining the fuel. It might have been contaminated. Or fuel 'waxing' may have occurred.  </font><font size="2">T</font><font size="2">his results from partial freezing, and pilots say the outside air temperature at some altitudes en route to the UK was down to minus 70 degrees that day - some of the coldest readings they could remember."</font></p></blockquote>
<p>Fascinating stuff I think you'll agree.  It could just be a coincidence.</p>
