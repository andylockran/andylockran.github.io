<p>Well it's been ages since I broke my leg.</p>
<p>I was riding home from school on the 12/05/1999 and got knocked down on Seven Star Road, Solihull.</p>
<p>I'm a very lucky guy - as the helmet made a huge difference to the outcome of the accident.  Thanks to that helmet, you now all get a few more MegaBytes of rubbish to read :)</p>
<p>The reason it took me so long to put on my helmet was this:</p>
<p>I made a bet with a teacher that there was a mistake with a question on the exam he'd given me.  It was a thirty minute exam.  The first question asked to reference a table - lets call it fig. a.  This table had three columns of variables - call them a.i, a.ii and a.iii.  The first question was a simple comprehension of each of the 5 rows.</p>
<p>The second question was much harder - and asked something like - if a.ii was raised <em>by </em>2 - then what would the answer be.  As the original figures were all under 2 - most people in the class read this as "if a.ii was raised <em>to </em>2."  I'm sure the scientists among you can spot the difference right away.  I had to reconstruct the table with these new values - then calculate the new values for a.iv a.v and a.vi - it took up the whole of the exam and I was still not finished.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I digress.  Said teacher decided that since the exam had been going out to students for "the last thirty years" - it was very egotistical of me to have claimed to identify a mistake - rather than accept my poor mark.  (I got 5% in comparison to most of the class getting 80-100%).</p>
<p>The teacher also made me sit at the front of the class - and if I were to lose, I was to stay there.. and if he were to lose - I get £15.</p>
<p>As it transpired - I was correct.  There was a failing on the exam.  (Of couse, if I was wrong I'd hardly be bloating about it now).</p>
<p>So - given that my deposition at the front of the class had made the "gentleman's agreement" a few of the 'more vocal' lads in the class really started laying into the teacher.  Looking back, it was must have been a stressful time for the teacher - with lads coming up and asking them where the £15 for Andy was.</p>
<p>So anyway, after a science lesson on the 12.5.99 - I was kept behind and given a firm talking to. (I also hadn't been moved back to my original seat in the class).  The teacher explained that it was "un-ethical" to bet with a student - therefore he was unable to pay.  Anyhow, I was impressed that he was easily able to not only prematurely and confidently placed me at the front of the class, assured of his win - but to keep me there even when the outcome had been reversed.</p>
<p>What made the day more exciting was that it was the day the GCSE students were released on study leave - which really meant that there'd be egg and flour in every bush leaving school by now - and some of those lads were pretty big and scarey.</p>
<p>I legged it down to my bike - got on it and pedalled as fast as I could until I was past solihull city centre.  I then got to the end of Ashleigh Road and put on my helmet.  You can see the diagram for the smash.. but three weeks in hospital is is an experience.</p>
