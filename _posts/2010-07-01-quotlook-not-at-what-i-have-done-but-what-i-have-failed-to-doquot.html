<p>It's an interesting phrase; some people are bound to recognise it - other maybe not.</p>
<p>It's quite easy to get into a habit of making sure you're in a safe place.  Take no risks, turn up and work 9-5 and do 'fun' stuff at the weekend.  It's a way of life that many people subscribe to, and becomes more appealing the older one gets - especially when caring for one's family becomes the number one priority.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, I'm a long way off that.  I've still got all the freedom and choices ahead of me as regards responsibility.  However, living with practically no responsibility has its drawbacks.  If I want to go and do something spontaneous, I've got little to hold me back; conversely, if I don't do anything then there's no one there to spur me on or challenge me.  </p>
<p>These last few months have been a bit of a 'breather' for me.  I've been in the normal work-life cycle and am generally happy with my performance.  Work hard, play hard would be the most recognisable mantra for the period.  It's got to a stage though where I need to perk up again.  Life is all about making sacrifices in order to achieve things, and for the last few months I've not had much sacrificing to do.</p>
<p>There would be some kind of point in announcing this as the new beginning and stating my claims as to what I'm going to do - but if it's one thing that I've learnt over the past few years - only talk about achievements in the past tense - talk about them in the future tense and they're worth nothing.  So the announcement is that I've started already, and watch this space for future developments.</p>
