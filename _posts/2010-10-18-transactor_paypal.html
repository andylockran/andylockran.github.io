<p>The following article will explain how to setup the transactor_paypal plugin to allow Paypal payments to be made using the tt_products typo3 extension.</p>
<p>The first step is to buy and install the transactor_paypal plugin from ttproducts.de  Once you've done that it's time to setup the test Paypal Accounts.</p>
<h2>Paypal</h2>
<p>Paypal's developer network has moved to www.x.com.  You need to setup a buyer account (with funds) and a seller account. </p>
<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>The following additions need to be made to the Template setup for the Shop.  Firstly, setup a Templates Sysfolder for the Shop.  Add ane extension template to that Sysfolder and name it 'Paypal.'  To the 'Setup' field add the folllowing code:</p>
<pre>
lib.transactor_paypal {
   extName = transactor_paypal
   extWww = www.paypal.com
   extTitle = PayPal Website Payments Standard
   extInfo = PayPal enables any business or consumer with an email address to securely, <br />conveniently, and cost-effectively send and receive payments online.
   extImage = EXT:transactor_paypal/res/paypal_euro.gif
   gatewaymode = form
   formActionURI >
   paymentMethod = paypal_webpayment_euro
   currency = EUR
   templateFile = EXT:transactor/template/transactor.tmpl
   useBasket = 1
   conf {
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Once that has been installed, you can then edit the config of the main root template for your shop.</p>
<p>Constants:</p>
<pre>plugin.tt_products.paymentActivity = verify</pre>
<p>Setup:</p>
<pre>plugin.tt_products {

  payment >
  payment {
  90.title = Paypal Gateway
  90.handleLib = transactor
  90.handleLib < lib.transactor_paypal
  90.image.file = EXT:transactor_paypal/res/paypal_euro.gif
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Also, in the Includes tab, under 'Basis' templates, add the Paypal Template from your Templates SysFolder.</p>
<h2>Edit products.tmpl</h2>
<p>On the Filesystem, you also need to edit your products template.  Add the </p>
<pre>
###MESSAGE_PAYMENT_SCRIPT###

inside the subpart

###BASKET_PAYMENT_TEMPLATE###
</pre>
<p>Empty your cache, reload your site â€“ and test it all out.</p>
<p>You may need to play with your templates to get things appearing as you wish, but that should be mostly there.</p>
