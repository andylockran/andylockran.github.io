<p>I deliberately stopped posting notes to facebook, as they were pretty much technology based.  As I face a much different future, I thought it apt to open up and share my thoughts on facebook too.<br />
<br />I leave for India in 24 days, so thought now's the time to let people know this blog is where it's at if you want to keep up to date with what I'm up to in India - the blog is going less-geeky.  Hopefully there'll be lots of comments you guys want to make - if so please comment on the actual blog and not on facebook! :)</p>
<p>If you also want to see how geeky I've become, please check out the older posts in the blog.  As a psychologist, I think I'v found a fantastic cure for insomnia!  However, if you like what you see, please checkout <a href="http://planet.ubuntu-uk.org">http://planet.ubuntu-uk.org</a> or my '<a href="http://blog.zrmt.com/googleb4a914b98f4ceed7/">recommended sites</a>' on the blog.</p>
