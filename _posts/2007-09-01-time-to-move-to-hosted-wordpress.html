<p>I've been a bit annoyed recently, in that I have gone through a few periods of computer inactivity recently (ill and playing golf) and on my return, my web server has been randomly down for two hours, and has either</p>
<p>a) come back up spontaneously,</p>
<p>b) stopped with no reasons in the logs.</p>
<p>I'm also a bit annoyed at the slowness, so want to move my wordpress from it's current place (on my server) to a hosted service.Â  Anyone got any clue if I can move it to my wordpress.com space and redirect this URL by changing DNS settings - or do I need to bite the bullet and buy myself some proper hosting?</p>
<p>Let us know please in the comments, or by mailing me @ andy at zrmt dot com.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
