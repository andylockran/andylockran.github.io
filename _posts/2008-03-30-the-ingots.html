<p>Want to do an ECDL but don't run MS Office?  There is an alternative.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theingots.org/">The INGOTS</a></p>
<p>QCA accredited in the UK, and coming to countries all over the world - the InterNational Grades in Office Technology is a platform-agnostic approach to computer education.</p>
<p>It's projects like this which will help the widespread adoption of non-MS products in both Education and Public Sector institutions.  Please take a look and consider mentioning the benefits to your friends/relatives/neighbours/milkman/strangers.</p>
<p>Great Work.</p>
