<p>It's a massively important area of discussion, with huge social implications.Â  However, because it comes under the "geek umbrella" - most people choose to ignore it or 'switch off' from the conversation.</p>
<p>"Digital Rights, and what "feature creep" can achieve in terms of illegal/immoral operation."</p>
<p>It's something that I think needs to be put in the forefront of the public psyche - in so far as legal issues are regarded by the majority.</p>
<p>Leaving social issues to a group of people often stereotyped as having negligible social skills doesn't seem to be a sensible idea.</p>
