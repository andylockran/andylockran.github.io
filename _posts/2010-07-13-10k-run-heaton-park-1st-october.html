<p>In line with my attempts at trying to be more proactive and putting a bit of pressure on myself, I was asked by a friend whether I'd join him in doing a 10K run at Heaton Park on the 1st October.</p>
<p>Initially I put it off - I'm more of the cycling type than the running type.  However, I did do a bit of running in India and quite enjoyed it, and setting myself a target would probably be a good thing to do, were I not to immediately give in at the nearest opportunity.</p>
<p>Therefore I'm going to make a public commitment to run this 10K.  It would be good to have a few people comment to know that I've got people pressuring me into doing this.</p>
<p>I'd also like to listen to suggestions for fundraising.</p>
<p>I'm going to be as open as possible, so will post workouts on the web too.  Endomondo.com is where I've uploaded my cycling workouts in the past, so I hope to be able to provide an RSS feed for people to track my workouts too.</p>
<p>Crazy Stuff.</p>
<p>edit: <a href="http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/user/116030"> is where to view my workouts.</a></p>
