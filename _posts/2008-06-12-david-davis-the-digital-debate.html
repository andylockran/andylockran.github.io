<p>Too many D's for my liking... but a fantastic marketing point.</p>
<p>After David Davis resigned from the Commons today, the speech he gave focused on where technology and policy collide.<br />
<blockquote>We will have, shortly, the most intrusive identity card system in the world, a    CCTV camera for every 14 citizens, a DNA database bigger than any dictator    should have with thousands of innocent children and millions of innocent    citizens on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>We witness and assault on jury trial - that bulwark against bad law and its    arbitrary abuse by the state, short cuts to our justice system will make our    system neither firm nor fair and the creation of a database state opening up    our private lives to the prying eyes of official snoopers and exposing our    personal data to careless civil servants and criminal hackers.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's definately time for the debate to happen.Â  Just because we can do things with technology doesn't mean we should.</p>
