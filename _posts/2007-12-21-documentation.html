<p>In a recent blog I wrote about how Meccano deliberately sabotaged the instructions to make kids use their intuition to solve problems.Â  Well I think it's only fair that if we hit problems we share the solutions.</p>
<p>Therefore, my solution today is the following:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Make sure the feature you are trying to implement is present in the release version of the software you are actually using.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It may not be the first time I have made this mistake - but I hope it's the last.</p>
