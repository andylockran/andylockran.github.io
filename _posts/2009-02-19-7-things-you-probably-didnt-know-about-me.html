<p><a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/seven-things-you-didnt-want-to-know-about-me/">Bruce Lawson</a> chain-lettered 	<a href="http://citizensheep.com/blog/2009/01/27/seven-things-you-may-not-know-about-me/">Michael Grimes</a> (aka Citizensheep), who in turn chain-lettered  	<a href="http://thegetgoodguide.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-me/">Nicky Getgood</a> who in turn chain-lettered <a href="http://www.danux.co.uk/article/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-me/">Daniel Davies </a>me 	into blogging about the 7 things you may not know about me.  So here we are - the good, the bad and the utterly pointless:<br />

<ol>
<br />	
<li>I weighed only 5"11 at birth, almost half the size of my youngest brother Charlie.</li>
<p>	
<li>I've supported over 5 football teams so far in my life; Aston Villa, Preston NE, Manchester City, Macclesfield Town.</li>
<p>	
<li>I crashed my first car within 12 hours of getting it (received at 2300, crashed at 1100 the next day).</li>
<p>	
<li>I am absolutely love Land Rovers and I've had 4 cars in 4 years.</li>
<p>	
<li>I really enjoy sailing and skiing - stuff without engines can be just as fun!</li>
<p>	
<li>I can speak a fair bit of French, and spent 11 weeks in France in 2003.</li>
<p>	
<li>I have had absolutely no formal training in IT since I was 13, and only did some very basic and infrequent programming on a ZX81.</li>
<p></ol>
<p>I nominate the following people to do the 7 things:<br />

<ul>
<br />	
<li><a href="http://www.petesodyssey.org">Pete Lewis</a></li>

<li><a href="http://commandline.org.uk">Zeth Green</a></li>
<p>	
<li><a href="http://www.spikereid.co.uk/">Andrew Reid</a></li>
<p>	
<li><a href="http://www.theopensourcerer.com/">Alan Lord</a></li>
<p>	
<li><a href="http://gordallott.blogsite.org/">Gord Allot</a></li>
<p>
