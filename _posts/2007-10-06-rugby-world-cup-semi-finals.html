<p>I've been paying quite a bit of attention to the world cup - as Rugby is my favorite spectator sport.  I would have loved to have played it more, but unfortunately a broken leg can be quite a barrier to playing :).</p>
<p>I know it's never a good idea to get carried away, especially as though it looks as though NZ are going to be formidable opponents in the Semis.  I just want to put my two cents worth in for letting the team know they played a blinder today - and it was fantastic.  I love watching rugby, and it's nice to see the underdogs beat what was quite an arrogant Australian team.   It's great to see the respect between the players though - something football misses greatly.</p>
<p>Onward and upward - lets hope the guys have a relaxing and focused week - and give themselves the best chance against the All Blacks next week.</p>
