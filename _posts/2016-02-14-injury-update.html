<p>It's been just over a week without any exercise being registered to Strava. My ankle has been slowly recovering, with plenty of <strong>R</strong>est, <strong>I</strong>ce, &amp; <strong>E</strong>levation.  It's been a bit of a weird one as each day I've woken up with a lovely ankle, only for the swelling to increase throughout the day, then pain to return in the evenings.  It's now mostly pain-free, but slightly tender around the ankle.  Hopefully I can get back to some slow jogging next week, and then back for the longer runs next weekend - though I won't be running the half marathon on Sunday.</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll get back in the game very shortly, having sorted out some physio exercises from Nuffield Health to sort out my body.</p>
