<p>I'd not come across this guy before, many other people probably have though.</p>
<p>Johnny Lee of the Carnegie Mellon University has adopted the Wii-mote as his IR sensor, and using a bluetooth connection to a PC has created Whiteboards, and Head Tracking.. amongst other uses.</p>
<p>I've just had a browse of Johnny's sourceforge page, and although the code has been ported to Mac (albeit with a few bugs) he's still looking for a Linux Developer to port the application.  I might have an 'unofficial' play with the software to see if I can port it - but I'm in no way an experienced programmer.  If you can do it - please do take a look.</p>
<p>I'm sure other people can see the potential that this could have on Linux games :)</p>
<p>We'll have 3D shoot-em-ups first.. come on :)</p>
<p>Here's the video that impressed me the most:</p>
