<p>I recently was introduced to <a title="TED" href="http://www.ted.com">www.ted.com</a>, a site which hosts a number of inspirational talks given at the TED conference each year.</p>
<p>TED has been happening for a few years now, and is touted as a chance for some of the greatest minds to get together and share something unique - their ideas.</p>
<p>I'm quite a fan of lay-science, and getting to know more about stuff that's really advanced.  We all have very different backgrounds and skill-sets - and I think it's the ability to appreciate these differences that makes things really special.  When I look at the wonderful invention of the <a title="StrandBeest" href="http://www.strandbeest.com">StrandBeest</a> by Theo Jansen, I can't help but feel inspired.</p>
<p>It's fantastic to see how people's minds tick, and this site is likely to provide me with hours of distraction in the future.  The phrase 'standing on the shoulders of giants' is something that can be overused.  However, in sharing these ideas, we're given access to a wealth of information.  It's precisely for these reasons that I advocate the use of Free/Libre Open Source Software.  Enjoy the site.</p>
