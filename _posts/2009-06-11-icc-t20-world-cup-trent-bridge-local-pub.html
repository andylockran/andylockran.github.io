<p>Bit of a long-winded title to a post, but would just like to say to those of you expecting to visit 'Trent Bridge' in Nottingham.  If you want a good local pub not more than a 5 minute walk from the ground, I recommend the <a title="Trent Navigation" href="http://www.trentnavigation.co.uk">Trent Navigation.</a> It was refurbished about 12 months ago, and provides a fantastic atmosphere, with fantastic food.</p>
<p>As it's slightly off the beaten track (but not far from the stadium) it's probably a fair bit quieter than the local ones.</p>
<p>Please do check it out if you're in the local area. :)</p>
