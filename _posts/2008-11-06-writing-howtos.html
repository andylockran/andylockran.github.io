<p>Writing howtos can be a great thing, or it can be a dangerous thing.  It's nice for people to spell out the pitfalls and reasonings behind certain decisions in a pretty standard process, but it's also a great was to fool onself that understanding a piece of software isn't necessary in order to use it well.  Sure, you can get away with a simple text editor without reading the instructions (though please ignore vi/emacs .etc).. but for more advanced software packages, there's nothing quite like reading the manual; and in some cases, people won't offer to help you out until you've shown a certain level of understading in the first place.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to write more howtos, as they're enjoyable to write, and very rewarding when people read them.  However, I want to be writing howtos that require a certain level of understanding on the part of the user, but also provide enough detail for 'educated' users to extend and improve.  That's what open source is all about, right?</p>
<p>Well, luckily for me there's a whole community of users also contributing.. hopefully when we pull together we'll get some good content up... in the meantime I'll put all posts up on the blog too :)</p>
