<p>Today I traveled from Macclesfield, Cheshire - to Harlow, Essex.  Why?  To watch the two teams do battle in the FA Cup, 1st round proper. It was a fairly interesting game to watch, Macc Town finishing 2-0 victors.</p>
<p>However, on the journey, I had my iPod in, and was listening to the #Ubuntu-UK Podcast, with Laura, Alan, Daviey and Tony.  They began with a very long discussion on KDE.. and Alan saying that he was going to spend an entire development cycle using Kubuntu.. though he hadn't got round to it yet.</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>I use Ubuntu on my work PC, home laptop, and private VPS(s).  I love the OS and it works wonders for me.  I used to run Xubuntu on my old laptop, but since upgrading I've been getting away with bog-standard Ubuntu. :)</p>
<p>So I've decided to follow Alan's lead... though I think I may have beaten him to it.  I intend to run Kubuntu for the entire intrepid release on my laptop.  I've started today (9th Nov @ 00.00) and will be running Kubuntu for the foreseeable future.  Hopefully I'll be able to submit some bug reports .etc and help out the Kubuntu community in general.</p>
<p>I started in Linux using KDE.. and made the switch to gnome (on Gentoo) when I started my first job.  Soon after I was googling for Linux distros that used gnome as default; found Ubuntu; and the rest (as they say) is history.</p>
<p>So here I go on my Kubuntu journey.  I'll need to switch stuff like mail over to K mail, Music over to amaroK.. but bear with me.. it could be an interesting ride :)</p>
