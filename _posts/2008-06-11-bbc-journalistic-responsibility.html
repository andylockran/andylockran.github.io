<p>One of the things that I think is missing from the BBC news WebSite is the name of the journalist who penned the article.  There are hundreds of articles on the BBC WebSite which are all unattributed.  Some of the articles are fantastic, whilst others provoke interesting debate.</p>
<p>In order for people to understand the stories better, by being able to know more about the background of the article, I think it would be good for the BBC to subtitle each article with the authors name, thereby allowing directing to disputes regarding the article.</p>
<p>Debates on the articles should be left to the BBC blogs - and more and more are appearing on the site.  However, newspapers and magazines publish their authors' information with the articles, therefore I think the BBC should too.</p>
