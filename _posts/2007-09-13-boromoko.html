<p>Well I've decided to start my own little side-project with the openmoko.  I really haven't the time to be playing with it at the moment (unfortunately) but also don't want to see it go.</p>
<p>Therefore... some lucky people are borrowing it over the next few weeks.  I'll get them to write a summary of how they found their experience with the phone.  (This is optional, in case you were worried about asking.)</p>
<p>I'm going to stick with people local to the SBLUG or FSFUK Manchester at the moment.  If you want to 'boromoko' to test anything or just have a play - please email me or leave a comment on this post (simply let me know your interested) and I'll try and divide the time fairly.</p>
<p>If anyone is reading this, as is based close to Manchester/Birmingham with a debug board for their moko - please get in touch so I can send the moko to you if one of my 'boromokoers' should brick the phone.</p>
<p>Hopefully more people will copy the name - I think it's quite catchy.</p>
<p>If you want to look for someone with a phone - join #boromoko on irc.freenode.net</p>
