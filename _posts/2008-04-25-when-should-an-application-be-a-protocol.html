<p>I'm not sure whether it's because I'm becoming more immersed technically in technology, rather than 'functionally' as I was previously, but it appears as though issues at the political level are clouding achievements at the technical level.</p>
<p>Zeth has posted before on a Social Networking protocol.  That is to say that applications such as facebook, myspace and bebo share alot of similar datafields.  Standardising these global fields and setting up a new social networking protocol would allow greater freedom of data-sharing, and enable more powerful "mash-ups" of data.</p>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee's book, "Weaving the Web" (which I am currently reading) is opening my eyes to just how self-deprecating his work has been.  Not only would his work have normally afforded him a very wealthy lifestyle should he have chosen to 'close' the development of the project and put restrictions on his work - but he actively encouraged other people to benefit from his work - even when the way in which they were taking his idea was contrary to his own.</p>
<p>Now, nearly twenty years after the 'World Wide Web' started to gain momentum into something recognisable as what we use today, we've not yet got to a point which has fulfilled Berners-Lee's vision.  He envisaged an open mine of information and collaboration.  Wikified browsers were the original intention - where collaboration and editing was a key as browsing.</p>
<p>Another example of a good application that would work better as a protocol is twitter.  I think the reason most people don't get twitter is that in essence its just an RSS feed.  Today, paulbradshaw suggested that there be a twitter feed created purely for football scores - not chatter, just results.  An RSS feed would have the same functionality - but a different interface.</p>
<p>In the same way that programmers have now begun to separate the content from the design with the advent of Content Management Systems and 'Blogs - so should things like twitter be more transparent about the platform on which it is built.  RSS is expandable and usable - twitter has released an open API to allow integration and collaboration - yet it's still hindered by having a Central Point of Control.  The initial design of the Web implied there was no central point necessary.  By manufacturing applications and functions so that a central point is necessary is to lose part of the magic and scalability of the Web.</p>
