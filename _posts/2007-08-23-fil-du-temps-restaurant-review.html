<p>I thought I'd try something a little different and write a review of the restaurant I went to whilst on holiday in France.  Normally I would not bother with a review, but I've visited this hotel nearly 5 times over the past 15 years, so thought it would be worth a recommendation.</p>
<p>Set in the lovely abbey village of Brantome, the restarant is set back from the river Dronne.  There are quite a few restaurants right next to the river, which is not surprising as Brantome is the 'Venice of Perigord' - the French region in which Brantome lies.</p>
<p>The restaurant is not one of the posher ones in the centre of the town - but they don't seem to cater too well for 'holiday' people.  This isn't a criticism of their standards, but a group of French-speaking English people would have to book in advance for a table.</p>
<p>Fil du temps is a beautiful restaurant serving good regional food at a decent price (menus @ 12€ 23€ and 35€).  The staff were excellent and recognised the family from our visits in previous years.  They cater fantastically for smaller children, and couldn't do enough to cater for our party of 13 people.</p>
<p>If you're in the area I recommend visiting this restaurant (and the glassworks diagonally opposite on the far side of the river, past the abbey).</p>
