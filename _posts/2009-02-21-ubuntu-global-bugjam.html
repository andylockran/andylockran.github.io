<p>I was at the Ubuntu Bug Jam today, at the offices of the Linux Emporium in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham.</p>
<p>I think it was a pretty successful day, and sets a good precedent for the next two days (though unfortunately I shall not be there).Â  Was also great to see the Ubuntu-UK PoC Dave Walker there, as well as Mez who led the session and helped clear up any queries held regarding the bugfixing.</p>
<p>I'd just like to say thanks to the guys @ Linux Emporium for putting up such a great venue for the BugJam, as well as providing all the necessities (tea and biscuits).</p>
<p>Also kudos to all the other guys that took the effort to make it to the Jam, and special praise to those who are giving their weekend up to continue the great work.</p>
