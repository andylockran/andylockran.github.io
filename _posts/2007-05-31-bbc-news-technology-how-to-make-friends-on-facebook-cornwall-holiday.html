<p>What a shocker!  I've just been away for the last five days to Cornwall for a nice holiday with my family (all eight of us) and I come home to find myself quoted on the BBC.  Nice suprise - now all I need to do is convince Rory to run a piece on the benefits that facebook have in using open source software.</p>
<p>Cornwall was fantastic.  The weather on the first night was terrible though, and my sister and I arrived a day late as she'd had a night out planned on the aturday.   Getting down to Cornwall on Sunday afternoon only took us 3 1/2 hours, so didn't really have any complaints.  However, when we got there the family were out and the awning to the motorhome was collapsed.  I wish I'd have taken a photo.  Needless to say ten minutes later my parents and the rest of the family arrived back to a motorhome that was awning less as I'd put it down and in the back of my car.</p>
<p>Apart from the lovely cycling, walking, swimming, kayaking, golfing and sunburning, the only other thing I did of note was karting.  This was excellent.  We went to the St. Eval Kart track and had a quarter of an hour session.  The karts went a max speed of 70mph, which is rather fast to be going in a little kart.  It was great fun though - and the best lap I set was only a few seconds of the best of the day.</p>
<p>The second time we went was wednesday, and unfortunately my little sister had a nasty crash on the first lap.  The "pro" in front of her crashed on a blind (but open) bend and she was slipstreaming him.  6 hours in Newquay and Truro hospitals and luckily all she escaped with was some heavy bruising and whiplash on the left side of her neck.  Initially it was a suspected broken pelvis.  Phew...</p>
<p>So now we're back in Brum after a 5 hour drive (weather has been atrocious today).  Back to work.</p>
