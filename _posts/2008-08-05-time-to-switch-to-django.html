<p>Over the last week, I've been playing with <a title="Purchase Orders" href="http://po.zrmt.com">http://po.zrmt.com</a>.</p>
<p>It scratches a very small itch for my uncles company - and is going to be quietly expanded to manage more and more things for him.  However, the current state of the program means that it'll work well enough 'as is' - but I really need a framework for developing the ideas further.</p>
<p>I'm already learning and seeing better ways of doing what I've already done.  I guess it's just the learning process kicking in... but there are lots of things that I'm not entirely happy with.  Feel free to take a look at the code :)  I guess it's time to switch to Django.</p>
<p>I've tried a couple of times to switch to Django.. but I never really managed to get off the ground.  However, I think this project required that I use a framework, and will also help me make the code scalable.  With the potential for this same project to be used by at least a handful of companies around Birmingham.. it's not something I should turn my nose up at (although it's unlikely to make me a millionaire).</p>
<p>I've always used php before for my web-coding.  It's one of those things that just seemed nice at home to me; sitting embedded in HTML.  I basically used it as variables for HTML processing.. without a loop or an array in sight!  I can see now where I can actually begin to use the programming to make things simpler.. not more complicated.  Ooh it's exciting.</p>
<p>The other thing is that it means applications I create are more likely to be used by other people.  Django applications (as far as I understand it) are a collection of lots of small apps based around a solid framework.  It means there's probably going to be less work for me, and less work for other people.  The comments that I made in "<a href="http://blog.zrmt.com/2008/07/17/using-the-long-tail/">Using the Long Tail"</a> are massively relevant.  The more applications there are around a common base - the more random and unique the connection between two applcations.</p>
<p>So soon I shall be starting my move to Django.  Hopefully there'll be a few readers that'll follow my trials and tribulations (and also help me with any potential problems).  The first thing I need to do is install it on a remote ubuntu server.. if there are any gotchas with doing that - please let me know.</p>
