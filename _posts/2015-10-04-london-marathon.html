<p>So the good news that came through my letterbox on Friday is that I now have a balloted place in the London Marathon 2016. I only started running a few years ago with Karly and I both doing the wonderful Couch25K programme by the NHS. That's not to say that before I was a couch potato, but that I hadn't found a way to 'get into' these longer runs.</p>

<p>Well thanks to #C25K, Karly is now a regular runner, and has completed a half marathon already, whilst my longest 'competitive' distance has been a couple of 10k races. The good news is that we've both been training for a half marathon for two weeks time, so our base level of fitness should mean the marathon doesn't present an insurmountable challenge.</p>
<p>Karly and I had a pact, that if one of us gets in then both of us would fundraise for the other entering via a charity entry. There are so many worthy causes that we could run for, but until we can get a place locked in we'll just focus on our training.</p>
<p>I'll try and keep up writing about the training experience, and will attempt at using technology to keep us motivated. Karly's already got the forerunner 225 - and my 920XT is now on order.</p>
