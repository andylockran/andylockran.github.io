<p>Today I managed to get out for a run, the first one since my half-ironman at the end of August. A major part of the decision was due to signing up to the Brighton half-marathon 2017. Last year it was easy to focus on the training because the London Marathon was such a famous event - but I need to remember the Brighton marathon is just as far!</p>

<p>So - I need to take it more serious than last year and get more regular and planned training activity in over the winter. A trip to Australia/NZ over new year should help give me lots of opportunities for running.</p>
<p>Will put my runs back on Strava - please give me abuse if you don't see me training! (Unless I get injured again!)</p>
