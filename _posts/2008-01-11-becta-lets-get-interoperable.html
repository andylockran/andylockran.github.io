<p>Finally some good news for the open source world coming out of BECTA.  Congratulations to all those involved behind the scenes who are promoting the open source offerings.</p>
<p>However, the biggest announcement in that article, for me at least, isn't the denouncement of Vista and Office, but the positive noises coming for document interoperability.  ODF should to all intents and purposes be the next global document format (it alread has ISO status).  OOXML is not a vendor-neutral or open format, thus should be excluded as an option.  It's good to see BECTA supporting that for educational purposes.</p>
