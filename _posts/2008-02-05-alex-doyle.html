<p>One of my mates is a rather good guitarist and I recently set him up with a new blog/website which he'll hopefully update.</p>
<p>As things stand he's just added a bit more info and moved a few things around.  It's a basic wordpress site, as I don't have the time to offer him anything more bespoke/exciting - and some of the formatting is dodgy. However, there's an interesting video and I'm sure he'd like to have a little more visibility (and opinions).</p>
<p>I know he's also looking for people to collaborate with around Brum.Â  If you like what you see do drop him a line.</p>
<p>So if you would pop to the site - it's <a href="http://www.alexdoyle.net">www.alexdoyle.net</a> . Get in touch with him via alex@ the domain.</p>
<p>Thanks, and enjoy the music.</p>
