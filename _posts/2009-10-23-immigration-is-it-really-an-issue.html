<p>The majority of the following video shows a bit of the bad-side of America.  The main points made are about why America shouldn't increase immigration, and it'll upset the balance of their country, and that wouldn't be good for them.</p>
<p>However, halfway through the talk, the speaker uses 'gumballs' to give an illustration about how much America need to do about 3rd world poverty.  It's a pretty good demonstration of how much population increase is happening.. yet the numbers today are even greater than when the video is published.</p>
<p>I do not endorse these guys views on immigration or anything else, what I do want to look at though is the little gumball example, and wonder if you should be doing a little bit more to help the majority of the world living in poverty.</p>
