<p>The Charter for Compassion is an awesome charter. I wholeheartedly agree with everything that it says, and publish the document under here in the hope that others will read it and affirm their support on the Charter for Compassion Website.</p>
<p><strong>The Charter</strong></p>
<p><strong>The principle of compassion</strong> lies at the heart of all religious, ethical and spiritual traditions, calling us always to treat all others as we wish to be treated ourselves. Compassion impels us to work tirelessly to alleviate the suffering of our fellow creatures, to dethrone ourselves from the centre of our world and put another there, and to honour the inviolable sanctity of every single human being, treating everybody, without exception, with absolute justice, equity and respect.</p>
<p><strong>It is also necessary</strong> in both public and private life to refrain consistently and empathically from inflicting pain. To act or speak violently out of spite, chauvinism, or self-interest, to impoverish, exploit or deny basic rights to anybody, and to incite hatred by denigrating others—even our enemies—is a denial of our common humanity. We acknowledge that we have failed to live compassionately and that some have even increased the sum of human misery in the name of religion.</p>
<p><strong>We therefore call upon all men and women</strong> ~ to restore compassion to the centre of morality and religion ~ to return to the ancient principle that any interpretation of scripture that breeds violence, hatred or disdain is illegitimate ~ to ensure that youth are given accurate and respectful information about other traditions, religions and cultures ~ to encourage a positive appreciation of cultural and religious diversity ~ to cultivate an informed empathy with the suffering of all human beings—even those regarded as enemies.</p>
<p><strong>We urgently need</strong> to make compassion a clear, luminous and dynamic force in our polarized world. Rooted in a principled determination to transcend selfishness, compassion can break down political, dogmatic, ideological and religious boundaries. Born of our deep interdependence, compassion is essential to human relationships and to a fulfilled humanity. It is the path to enlightenment, and indispensible to the creation of a just economy and a peaceful global community.<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">I really believe that we as a society share the responsibility for improving the lives of our people, and that it shouldn't be left to others to do.  This is a charter designed so that people from all backgrounds should be able to affirm it.</p>
<p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thank you Karen Armstrong, especially the launch today... exactly what I was looking for!</p>
