<p>About a year ago I had to install a XMPP server on my company's server.  I looked around as to what was available and settled on JiveSoftware's Wildfire Server.  It connected to my LDAP server for authentication (a major requirement) and looked quite smart.  A year on - I'm stilll really pleased with my choice.  A colleague recently phoned me up to ask for advice on installing a jabber server - and came back to me massively impressed with the ease at which he was able to do it.</p>
<p>A year on, and now Wildfire has been renamed <a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp" title="OpenFire">Openfire</a>.  The philosophy of the company behind it is to release both an "enterprise version" and an "open source" version.  In all honesty I think this is a good approach to commercialising open source - as they've managed to give SME's a fantastic server - whilst being able to generate some profit for development off larger enterprises.</p>
<p>Openfire also supports it's own user database - but having a LDAP backend suits me much more.  You can even map certain attributes to LDAP fields - so the Jabber Server also becomes another front-end for you contact list and addressbook.  It's an added bonus.</p>
<p>There are also lots of plugins for it - and plenty of information should you wish to write your own.  They're all administered through a really fantastic web-interface.  It's probably one of the easiest web-interfaces that I've used.  It has everything there, and has improved massively over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>So, if you're looking for a Jabber server - choose openfire.</p>
