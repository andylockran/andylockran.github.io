<p>Well I'm having quite some fun.  I had a look at the facebook api today, and at FBML (FaceBook Markup Language).  There doesn't seem to be a high barrier to entry to development, therefore I'm going to have a little play over the weekend.  I've got a nice idea for an application that has yet to be implemented - so I'll let you all know when it's finally released.</p>
<p>The thing I like most about developing an application for facebook is there there's a pre-defined user-base - therefore the applications can be nicely targeted.  I find that the most annoying thing about applications is the space they take up on the profile page - I'm going to keep that to a minimum so more people will keep the application even if they don't use it daily.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I've been working really hard a work and have really worn myself out.  I'm also getting quite far with the development of www.lnmf.info - but I've had to beg, borrow and steal from other sites to get it looking as I wanted in as fast a time as possible.  All the proceeds are going to the charity mentioned in the site - so I hope there are few complaints.  I was also able to implement zetact, a contact form by Zeth Green in python.  It's nice and simple and does exactly what it says on the tin.  I shall now be bombarding Zeth with the possibility of a captcha and askimet integration... all in good time.</p>
<p>Aside from that my online life has been dead recently.  I've not been able to hang out in #ubuntu-uk as much as I'd like and feel as though I'm slipping behind.  I'm taking a break tomorrow as Martin &amp; Daniel are coming up from Birmingham; and across from Liverpool (respectively) for the weekend so will have a nice chilled out day with them.</p>
<p>Managed to fit the time in to watch Hot Fuzz tonight; I thought it was a brilliant comedy.  Some good laugh out loud moments, as well as the cringing and the situation comedy.  I recommend it fully.</p>
<p>Right - well it's 1.09 am so I'm going to call it a night.</p>
<p>Night!</p>
