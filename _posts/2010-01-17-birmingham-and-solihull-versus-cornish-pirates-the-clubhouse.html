<p>What a fantastic result!</p>
<p>I've just spent the last couple of hours down at the Sharman's Cross Clubhouse with around 100 fantastic bees supporters.  It's great that so many would turn up to see the match broadcast over Cornish Pirates' brilliant Internet TV.  Thanks to the guys for setting it up - both at the Birmingham and Solihull end, and the team down in Cornwall.</p>
<p>With the new recruits, Birmingham and Solihull now have fantastic strength in depth and hopefully this will encourage competition for places and an re-energised team ethic.  Today's performance was the result of only two full training sessions together - and not all of the new signings have yet arrived.  The rest of the season is starting to look like it has potential.</p>
<p>Coming up on Wednesday Evening is a trip up to Rotherham - a team Bees are likely to be facing come the relegation playoffs in March/April.  With a fixture backlog due to the poor weather over the last few weeks - we can but hope that the squad keeps match fit - and that the new guys step up to the plate alongside the guys who have carried the club through the last few months.</p>
<p>2010 is looking much brighter based on today's result.  It was great in the clubhouse; brilliant atmosphere and Ant Elliot gave a speech at the end of the match stating how important it was that we get more people down to Sharman's Cross.  If you've not been down and fancy coming along - there's lots of people there more than happy to give you a warm welcome.</p>
<p>For those of you immersed in the world of twitter, Bees launched their own Twitter-er this week, so visit <a href="http://twitter.com/BSBeesRugby">BSBeesRugby</a> for the latest coming out of SXR.</p>
