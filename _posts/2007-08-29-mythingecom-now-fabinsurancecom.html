<p>I thought I'd post this, as I don't want to good kudos that I gave in a recent review to go to waste. :</p>
<p>Email from fabinsurance.com:<br />
<blockquote>Over the last few months, you've told us what you like about our website, and what you don't.</p>
<p>One thing that has come through loud and clear is that you did not particularly like our name.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of weeks, we've brought on board two new board<br />members, including a new Marketing and Business Development Director,<br />Cesarina Holm-Kander (who you may know from the Channel 4 programme<br />Your Money Or Your Wife.)</p>
<p>Cesarina described the business as Fab, and came up with the name<br />FabInsurance.com</p>
<p>We have now completed the re-branding - we hope you like our new look<br />and our new logo.</p>
<p>Please be reassured that you do not need to re-register. Your existing<br />details (including your password) are exactly as they were, as are the<br />details of any insurance auctions you have runnning at the moment.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mark Harrison, for the FabInsurance.com team</p></blockquote>
