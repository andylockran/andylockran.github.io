<p>I'm in the market for a new mobile phone. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>The one I have at the moment is rather simple, and I'm looking forward to getting a smartphone. &nbsp;The iPhone does look cool, but it won't cut it for me as it's not going to work with my ubuntu machines - and as that's my operating system of choice, I don't want to have to boot into MS for anything... VM is a no-no too. &nbsp;I'm pure ubuntu.</div>
<div>I fancy something that can hold music, works with Spotify (I have premium, so that offline stuff looks awesome), and has the potential of replacable SD memory, 16GB or greater.</div>
<div>So my choices.. well I could go with Symbian or Android on the phone - Windows Mobile is once again something that I don't want to spend time with.</div>
<div>Coming out on the 29th March in the UK (on o2, my preferred carrier) is the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/xperiax10?cc=gb&amp;lc=en">Sony Xperia X10</a>&nbsp;- and it seems to tick many of the boxes, aside from the fact that it's not yet available. &nbsp;I'm also told it'll ship with Android version 1.6, rather than 2.0.</div>
<div>So, can someone please give me some advice on which phone works well with Ubuntu, what I should be looking out for, and which ones are best to avoid.</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
