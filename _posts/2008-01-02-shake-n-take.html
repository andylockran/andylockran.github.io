<p>I know some people are quite fond of photography.  On Flickr there are lots of photography groups where people peer-mark each others work, and generally give each other a pat on the back - which I like.  However, let me bring to you a slightly different phenomenon - shake 'n' take.The instructions are simple.
<ol>	
<li>Get a Camera</li>
<p>	
<li>Get your subject to relax their face, then start to shake their head. (either vertically or horizontally - each approach/plain leads to different results)</li>
<p>	
<li>Take their picture as their face moves from side to side.. and have a good laugh at the results</li>
<p></ol>
<p>I've done the 'chore' and created a <a href="http://mmu.facebook.com/group.php?gid=6970892910">facebook group</a> dedicated to the cause - however, if facebook isn't the think for you; post your links to the comments form at the bottom of this page - and hopefully we'll end up with a collection of rather amusing photos.</p>
