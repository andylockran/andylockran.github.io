<p>After taking a tumble on my bike the other week, I decided to look at the options for upgrading my bike caliper's. I've got a Trek 1.5 H2 2012, bought as Olympic fever was gripping Britain, and ridden exponentially more miles than any other bike I have owned before.</p>
<p>The options on the Trek 1.5 are limited, due to the fact that it requires 'long reach' brake calipers (it leaves plenty of room for mudguards). I ended up settling on the<a title="Shimano R650s" href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/shimano-r650-dual-pivot-57mm-drop-brake-caliper/" target="_blank"> Shimano R650s</a> - not too expensive at ~Â£28 each, and arrived within a couple of days from the wonderful Wiggle.</p>
<p><a href="http://zrmt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/shimano-brr650f-med.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1728" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/shimano-brr650f-med.jpg" alt="shimano-brr650f-med" width="257" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>Needless to say, they were a cinch to fit, and after making a few minor adjustments to the brake shoes and centering the brakes - have made one massive difference.</p>
<p>With my previous stock brakes, I'd replaced the shoes a few times and maintained the brakes by checking whether they were centered - but the consistency of braking with the new calipers is much more like the brakes on my Dad's Madone 3.1 SRAM setup. I can 'feel' the road a lot better, and even attempted to lock-up on my way into work this morning on the wet road - but was able to feel my way far better than before.</p>
<p>That said, it may all be psychological and the old calipers have just worn from thousands of miles of wear and tear. Do let me know if you've performed a similar upgrade, or have recommendations on what I should upgrade next. By all accounts, it looks like the <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/campagnolo-zonda-clincher-wheelset/" target="_blank">wheels will be the next upgrade </a>- but that's probably a birthday present to myself in March - once the weather has improved.</p>
