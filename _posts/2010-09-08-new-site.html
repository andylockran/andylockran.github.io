<p>In what has been a bit of a different step for me, I've decided to move over to having a more 'site-orientated' presence, rather than my previous blog engine. &nbsp;Though the idea seems like a fairly trivial one; I feel as though bashing out blog post after blog post is not the best way for me to present myself on the internet. &nbsp;The blog should be part of something bigger - and so here it is - hidden away behind an 'Articles' menu on the new look zrmt.com site.</p>
<p>One of the things that's changed over the few years that I've had a consistent web presence, is that my focus of interaction keeps switching. &nbsp;One time it was blogs, now it's twitter, and I'm sure something else with succeed that in the future. &nbsp;I'm hoping that this site can act as the anchor to hold it all together. &nbsp;Only time will tell.</p>
<p>One of the things I'd like to bring attention to is my new 'IT/Work' page - on there you'll discover a bit more about me, and a fantastic list of sites that have come to life over the previous few months. &nbsp; Feedback is always welcome, but some of them may be providing services in your local area - do check them out.</p>
<p>Thanks, and enjoy the new site.</p>
