<p>Well it's been a really fantastic couple of weeks.  Having been asked to play bass at a set of concerts I've been trying to resurrect a talent that has lain dormant for far too long.  I use the term 'talent' loosely - but I managed to get it together for the two nights.</p>
<p>We did two concerts, on Friday and Saturday at the local Church Hall in Olton Friary, South Brum.  It was a really good little concert, with Liz singing some great Jazz hits like "I love you porgy" and some more poppy ones such as "Sunny Afternoon" which became a spontaneous sing-a-long for the audience.  We had a couple of sing-a-longs such as "Build me up Buttercup" and "I'm a Believer."   They both went down really well and the 6 o'clock Choir helped lead the singing.</p>
<p>Also, will not forget for a while a lovely rendition of "Underneath the Arches" by Liz's Dad Stan North, and Mike Murphy.  Those two had the place in stitches with a very 'unique' performance.  Alex, Simon Liz and I had the final set (having performed on "Look of Love" in the second set) and made it a little more upbeat with our own version on "Ain't no Sunshine" (with blues jam) which people danced and jived too.  We also did Cream's "Sunshine of your Love" and "Johnny B. Goode" which went down fantastically - with Alex deserving particular acclaim for his fantastic guitar playing.</p>
<p>I'm just thankful to be surrounded by people with such talent.  Liz has an amazing voice, and played a fantastic acoustic set of Hallelujah (Jeff Buckley) accompanying herself on guitar.  Simon is the most versatile pianist I know - who runs the keys beautifully - and Alex has earnt himself the title of "Virtuoso Guitarist" from many years spent doing the hard graft.  He's a very accomplished player.</p>
<p>I'm just sad to have it all ended - but we did it all for a noble cause, and hopefully (now I have some more time) I'll be able to get the website populated with some information at lnmf.info.  You'll also be able to get a good biography of Liz's Mum - whose untimely death was the reason for the charity fund-raising.</p>
<p>There are CDs available from last years concert (for a donation) so if you want one please send me an email (though I do appreciate you'll be buying blind).  They do have a myspace page - but in true Andy style I no longer use myspace so don't know what it is.  Do a search for Liz and Simon perhaps - and "Hotel California."</p>
<p>I'll hopefully update once the site's running - I should imagine I'll put a couple of mp3/ogg songs up there.</p>
