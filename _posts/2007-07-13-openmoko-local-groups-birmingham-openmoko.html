<p>Well alot of you are probably away that I'm waiting for the openmoko phone to arrive.  Well the days are getting closer and they're due to be shipped out on Monday.</p>
<p>There's been lots of talk on the lists about the lack of communication from FIC, Harald's blog at planet.openmoko.org and the general negativity coming out of the project.  However, if you get behind the scenes on the IRC #openmoko and the mailing lists, there's actually a underswell of positivity (and a few idiots asking the same questions over-and-over-and-over again).</p>
<p>I'm not sure how many people are going to have the neo1973 around Birmingham, but I've set up a brummie-location on the openmoko wiki.  So if you're interested in having a look at the phone before you buy, you should be able to find someone with a phone to meet up with.</p>
