<p>It's a bit of a joke really.  First of having to rely on a team like Israel to even give England a chance of getting to the European Finals - and then to belittle a team with as much quality as Croatia - with the majority of pundits expecting England to beat them easily.</p>
<p>I was rather amused at being able to see the "gridiron" from the wonderful NFL match held at Wembley three weeks ago - but the best bit was this.</p>
<p>Due to the gridiron being smaller in width than a football pitch, the "touchline" for the gridiron was ten yards inside England's right wing during the first half.  I now ask you to watch an NFL game, with all the circus standing on the sidelines.  We have "technical areas" - they have hoodlum asylums - everyone can stand their.. pacing up and down and RUINING THE FOOTBALL PITCH!</p>
<p>Now if this isn't yet another example how the media (especially Mr Murdoch) are ruining the "beautiful game" then I don't know what is.  That, and the fact that the media were belittling Croatia.  They're a good side, and I think it's going to be a very interesting second half.</p>
