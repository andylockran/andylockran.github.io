<p>Only the eagle-eyed regular reader will have noticed that my blog title has changed. No longer is my sport of choice Cycling, but since applying and getting into the London Marathon I'm adding running to the roster. Who knows - I may even start swimming to get my Tri-game on in 2016?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.andyloughran.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/river-thames-half-logo.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1803" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/river-thames-half-logo-300x155.png" alt="river-thames-half-logo" width="300" height="155" /></a></p>
<p>Tomorrow is going to be my first half marathon at the <a href="http://www.riverthamesrunning.co.uk/" target="_blank">River Thames Running</a> half marathon over in West London/Surrey.  I'd like to say my prep for it was good, but looking at my Strava widgets on the right side of my blog will tell you that despite getting some good distances under my belt, the frequency of my runs has been no where near as good as it shout be up to this point.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Karly and I have both come down with some kind of head cold, so today's all about rest and relaxation.  It's the third half marathon I've signed up for, but the first I'll hopefully attend.  The first one I ended up on holiday in Egypt instead, and the second I was also too unwell to run.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's going to be something else though - 6am wakeup for an 8.30am start; then a megadash to get changed and ready before I get to see Scotland v Australia at Twickenham at 4pm.  I'll post an update on how the marathon went tomorrow night.</p>
