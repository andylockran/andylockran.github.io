<p>As many of you will be aware, I relocated to Manchester, UK, a few months back.</p>
<p>Imagine my annoyance then, when, on the night of the fight, absolutely no places in Manchester were "general  admittance" at 3am this morning.</p>
<p>I hope Hatton wins, comes back to Manchester, and smacks all the idiotic bar owners that didn't open for the fight.. ok the bars would be full of drunks - but how does that compare to any other night.</p>
