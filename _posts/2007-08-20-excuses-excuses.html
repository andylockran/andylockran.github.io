<p>First off I need to make a big apology to Zeth and other people at SBLUG.  I had said I was going to be coming to the meeting last Thursday, without recalling it was the A level results day and my Sister was getting her results.</p>
<p>I ended up celebrating with her instead of coming out to the meet.  However, I now have a neo1973 - and to all intents and purposes I will be bringing it to Septembers meeting for people to take a look at.</p>
<p>Hopefully will see you guys then!</p>
