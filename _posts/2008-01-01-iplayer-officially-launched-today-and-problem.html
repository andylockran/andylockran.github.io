<p>The iPlayer was officially launched today - as you may have been made aware by the advertising over the Christmas period.  One Problem.I sat down to watch the Top Gear "Polar Express" episode on the mac mini attached to my TV.. and lo and behold it's stuttering every 2 minutes to re-buffer the content.What a reet pain in t'arse. </p>
