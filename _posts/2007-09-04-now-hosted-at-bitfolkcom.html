<p>Well I'm very impressed.  I was sent a very comprehensive welcome pack with my hosting, there are loads of tools I can use to check my bandwidth status, and the hosting was set up and all up to date.  It's running much faster than my home installation, and I've managed to migrate a few sites tonight.  The main thing left is to wait for the DNS to update across the world, and then start getting hits.  I decided on a new beginning, so all my stats are starting from zero.</p>
<p>One other good thing is that they have a local ubuntu repo mirror - meaning updating packages takes no time at all to download.  Fantastic (I think it may not even count towards bandwidth limits, but I'll check).</p>
<p>Hopefully I'll soon get past the levels of the previous server.</p>
<p>Thank you bitfolk.com.</p>
