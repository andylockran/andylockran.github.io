<p>I'm not sure how many people are aware of this, but Stephen Fry has just started a column in "The Guardian Weekend" - a magazine that comes with the Guardian on Saturdays.  The title of the column is "Dork Talk"; quite appropriate for the topics he will be discussing.</p>
<p>In his introduction (which I would encourage you to read) he paints himself as being someone who will be taking an interest in these technical devices not just from their functional or stylistic behaviour - but their holistic presentation.</p>
<p>It could be a rather interesting column, so I'll leave you to judge whether or not to read it.  If you don't fancy the column, then just read up online at the blog link I posted at the start of this blog.</p>
