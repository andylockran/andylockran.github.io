<p>For a while now I've been considering joining the British Computer Society - now that I expect my career to evolve in the IT sector.  I'm already a member at some Open Source specific organisations, such as the OSC and the OpenDocumentFellowship, but I'm sure getting a better understanding of the global view of the IT sector could be a great education.</p>
<p>I've come across the BCS on multiple occasions - my Dad is a member - and thoroughly respect it as a collective of some very important and authoritative names in IT.  I read through its <a href="http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.2957" title="Example Article">published articles</a> frequently.  So should I join?</p>
<p>At the moment my role is Systems Administrator on a Linux Server Setup that I manufactured of Open Source components in 2006.  There are now two organisations with the server in place in the same form that I installed it with, and a few more who are on a long-term migration strategy.  Implementation has recently been held up due to PCI DSS work I've been doing.  My role I hope to improve to include project management, and as I become more familiar with the capabilities of the small organisation I work for - to help expand the business to fight for bigger and better contracts.</p>
<p>I think the networking ability that BCS membership affords me more than covers the cost of membership - but I'm interested to know other peoples' views.  Are you a member? If so, why? And if not, why not?</p>
<p>I'm also interested in the Open Source Working Group at the BCS (though I believe it to be geographically based in London, and I'm in Manchester).  If anyone's from the Manchester Branch, I'd love to hear your view too.</p>
<p>One think that does impress me is that the <a href="http://www.bcsmanchester.org.uk/" title="BCS Manchester">Manchester Branch WebSite</a> uses Drupal... one less hurdle to overcome in my quest for FOSS domination!  :)</p>
