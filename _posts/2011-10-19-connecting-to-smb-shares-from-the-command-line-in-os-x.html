<p>I'll keep this one short for brevity. It's sweet and simple. If you're anything like me you're probably using at least 10 different operating systems at once. Well, that might be a slight over exaggeration, but I certainly use at least three in my home. Here's the problem that I faced this evening and how I overcame it.</p>
<p>I have a linux server which is sharing some data using a samba share (SMB). Connecting to this from my windows box is simple, since microsoft is good enough to make mounting shares over SMB a piece of cake. My MacbookPro running OS X Lion, however, was a different story.</p>
<p>One option is to use the finder to manually connect to the share, but since I often connect to various computers using SSH I wanted to find a purely command-line solution. Thankfully, it's super simple. Just use the UNIX command mount - as follows:</p>
<p><strong>mount -t smbfs //&lt;username&gt;@&lt;ip or fqdn&gt;/&lt;share name&gt; &lt;mount point&gt;</strong></p>
<p>The example of this on my network is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>mount -t smbfs //james@192.168.0.4/james /Users/jamesanslow/linuxserverfiles</strong></p>
<p>Note: you will require smbfs + samba installed + configured for this to work (<a title="How to install samba on Ubuntu" href="http://jamesanslow.net/blog.html" target="_blank"><em>duh?</em></a>)</p>
