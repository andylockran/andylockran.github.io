<p>Since getting myself a new mountain bike a few weeks back, I've used it to climb over the peaks, and also to commute to work. &nbsp;However, in just under a month I'm going to be running a 10K in Heaton Park, Manchester. &nbsp;This weekend I'm heading back to Knowle for a family meal, and have decided that it'd probably be quite nice to take the bike home with me and do a stint whilst I'm down there. &nbsp;Hopefully I'll manage to drag a sibling or two along, and we'll head out for a jaunt along the canal.</p>
<p>I've decided to make this into a bit of a game, and for every &pound;1 that I get sponsored between now and 1pm Saturday, I'll do 1 mile on the bike. &nbsp;To prove I've done it, I'll be uploading my gpx track to endomondo. &nbsp;If you fancy putting your hand in your pocket to help set the ball rolling, please visit my site, and click Donate.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>* there's going to have to be an upper limit of 50 miles - but feel free to donate past that point, as it'll be going towards my run anyway.</em></p>
