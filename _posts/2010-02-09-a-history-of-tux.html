<p>I was on facebook this evening and managed to find myself perusing a friend's photos, when I came across a very random one indeed.  It was then I realised that it was not my friend's album, but a friend of theirs, as I was unable to comment directly. </p>
<p>However, it's probably for the best as it would have revealed my geekdom, therefore beneath this writing I publish "This History of Tux" (according to Canberra Zoo).<br />
