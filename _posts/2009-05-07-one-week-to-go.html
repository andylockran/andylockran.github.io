<p>It's come around very fast, but in a weeks time I'll be just about to land at heathrow, after a great trip to India.  I've done so much stuff since I've been here, and honestly believe that it's going to have a profound affect upon my character.  </p>
<p>The one thing that has really struck me is the moral arguments and reasoning that I've been forced to consider; though not necessarily directly affecting me - but people very close to me out here.  I know now to value social services much more than I currently do, and I already respect the NHS for providing me with fantastic healthcare in the few occasions that I've had need to call upon it for help.</p>
<p>After reading Nelson Mandela's autobiography last week, I made much of the link between S.A. and India in S.A's fight for equal rights and the abolition of apartheid.  There's so much political wrangling - especially now during the elections.  </p>
<p>I really hope I can come back to India.  It's a fantastic country, with lovely people.. just a shame that at the moment it's so hot!</p>
