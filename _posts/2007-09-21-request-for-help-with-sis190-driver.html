<p>Well this is fun.  4 hour battling with Centos 5 to get a driver re-installed that's already meant to be working.</p>
<p>I'm not going to post all the details here, as it's really been a very long day and needless to say it's just not working so I can't be bothered.</p>
<p>However, if any of you kind souls have got the sis190 driver working with your centos5 release.  I'd be _very_ happy to head from you.  Please leave me howtos/links in the comments if you think they can be of use.</p>
<p>I've never had this much of a problem before with linux (evidently the driver works on on ubuntu and gentoo).. but it's Centos that I have to install..</p>
<p>please help :(</p>
