<p>Had an exam this morning, so was completely focused on that, but when I came back, I got a torch and had a look in the upturned pot with the eggs in.  They have now hatched, and it appears that there are some tiny black tails sticking out of what can only be described as mini-splodges.  They won't be free-swimming for a couple of days.  But these dudes are tiny.</p>
<p>I would love to take a photo, but I don't want to disturb them, and it is far to difficult to get the camera to focus inside the tiny hole.</p>
<p>I hope to report some free swimming badis-badis by Thursday Night!</p>
