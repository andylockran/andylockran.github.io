<p>* To all my friends who have received the SPAM mails recently, I apologies profusely.</p>
<p>It's quite annoying when you receive SPAM from one of your own email addresses.  In my case, it was plum202@hotmail.com.</p>
<p>It's an address I registered and used way-back-when - and hasn't seen me using it for the last 5-6 years.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I logged onto it, and tried to close my account.  However, I could not do so as there was a 'billing account linked to your Live ID.'  I was advised to goto https://billing.microsoft.com to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>However, on landing at https://billing.microsoft.com - I was greeted with a message to say "This Live ID does not have a billing relationship with Microsoft.  Please Click Here to join.</p>
<p>Silly Microsoft.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I phoned their customer support... three different numbers I was passed between til ending up with some Hotmail specific department.  I spent over an hour on the phone in total, and finally ended up with the support guy passing an email onto someone else to take a look.</p>
<p>The best thing about it - the guy set a gmail.com address as the reply-to: address.</p>
<p>I thought I'd ask him a few questions and get him to give me some advice on hotmail versus gmail.  He duly obliged, telling me to goto google.com and sign up there 'or something like that.'</p>
<p>Yeah.. bear this in mind when you next choose a Webmail provider.</p>
