<p>SEO is not something that I'd ever want to get into.  At the end of the day your efforts are centred around trying to get the best out of a hidden search algorithm.  There are guidelines for how to do it, but the algorithm and sites can change at the whim of the algorithm writers.</p>
<p>I've started using Google Webmaster Tools, and part of what it reports is which searches find your site.  As it turns out, I must use the words 'touch' 'man' and the phrase 'how to' a fair bit throughout this blog, hence I'm scarily high up on the google rankings for 'How to touch a man.'</p>
<p>I found it amusing - has anyone else got funny search queries that return their site in the top 10?  Please post below.</p>
