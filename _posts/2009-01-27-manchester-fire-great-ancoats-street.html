<p>I had a pretty nice evening.  Met up with a couple of friends after a hard day at work, and headed out for a couple of drinks @ ODD bar, in the Northern Quarter.  I'd then arranged to meet an ex-flatmate, just outside the Northern Quarter.  He needed some Unix CLI help, so I was the man.</p>
<p>After sorting out his problems, I realised time had gotten on.. so we wished each other hasty goodbyes, then I headed out of the flat.. only to be greeted by a thick fog, with a light smell of smoke.</p>
<p>After working out that it wasn't his flat that was on fire (or his building), I told him I'd report back, and headed home.  Once I had left the block, I could immediately tell the direction the fire was coming from, and as it was on my way home - I walked towards the fire.</p>
<p>It was at <a href="http://www.investmentpropertycentre.co.uk/property/sarah/sarah.htm">this building.</a></p>
<p>Realising it was a fairly big event, I phoned up <a href="http://twitter.com/commanderspike">@commanderspike</a>, and he headed out, armed with a camera.</p>
<p>The smoke was high in the air, and lots of it too; massively surprising given that the building on fire looked like a shell.  By the time I arrived (circa 0100), the firemen appeared to have it under control. We watched for a few minutes, and then noticed the fire re-take on the far corner from where we were standing.  However, at that point a couple of appliances left the scene, as the situation was under control.</p>

<p>I told <a href="http://twitter.com/commanderspike">@commanderspike</a> to tweet, which he duly did.. and I tweeted as soon as I got home.  I got a response from <a href="http://twitter.com/paul_fernley">@paul_fernley</a>, journalist @ Key103 - and <a href="http://twitter.com/commanderspike">@commanderspike</a> has a journo friend who is also running with the story.</p>
<p>There's also another angle too, as after <a href="http://twitter.com/commanderspike">@commanderspike</a> and I tweeted, we both did a little web-browsing.  However <a href="http://twitter.com/commanderspike">@commanderspike</a> came up with the goods with the following tweet:</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/commanderspike">@commanderspike</a> The site of the fire is the Sarah Tower, a project now on hold due to the credit crunch. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bp8se2">http://tinyurl.com/bp8se2</a> .</p>
<p>It looks like the building company are in massive financial difficulties.  Puts a bit of an angle on the story for any journalist wishing to cover it.  Hopefully there'll be some coverage tomorrow.. though I've got such a busy day I hope there's not too much!</p>
