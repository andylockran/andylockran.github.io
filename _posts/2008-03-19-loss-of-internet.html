<p>Only recently I was listening to a radio4 program and how the left-wing argument was that the internet has become like water and electricity to 21st century citizens.  Well it's more than that to those of us that rely on it to work remotely.  Especially those of us that live 100 miles or more from the majority of our clients.</p>
<p>Therefore imagine my frustration when it took me</p>
<p>a) 30 mins to find a premium rate number to call Virgin Media</p>
<p>b) 2 minutes to realise that the number wasn't working.</p>
<p>c) about 90 mins to get through to the right person @ Virgin Media after dialling 118-118.</p>
<p>d) three minutes to be told it's a known issue, but we've yet to update our status helpline/online page.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
