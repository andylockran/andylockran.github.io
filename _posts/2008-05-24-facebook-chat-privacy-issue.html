<p>Just discovered a pretty random 'feature' on Facebook Chat.</p>
<p>I don't know how many of you use facebook's relatively new chat feature.  It's a small box in the bottom right of the browser.  Anyhow, yesterday I logged into my account on the iMac downstairs.  It's a private PC that only me and my family use, so I left my facebook account logged in downstairs.</p>
<p>Earlier this afternoon, I spoke with one of my friends on the facebook chat.  We had a short conversation, without any confidential/personal information being discussed - but a chat nonetheless.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I just turned the screen on the iMac, and the facebook page was still up in Safari - and to my horror, the chat that I'd had upstairs on my own PC was shown up in the bottom right of the screen in the Safari browser.  Therefore, I can only assume that what I typed upstairs was broadcasted to my logged in account realtime - without me knowing.</p>
<p>Normally when I log into a site, I expect it to log me out elsewhere - especially with Instant Messenger.</p>
<p>Watch out for the same thing catching you out!</p>
