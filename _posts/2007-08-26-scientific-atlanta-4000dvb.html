<p>The Scientific Atlanta 4000DVB set top box was the model of choice for telewest, having been released back in 2001.  There is an ethernet connection on the back of the box, and I'm looking to work out what functionality (if any) I could get from attaching the set top box to my home network.</p>
<p>I can't find any information on google - so was wondering if anyone else had tried it.  Please leave a comment if you have any advice.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
