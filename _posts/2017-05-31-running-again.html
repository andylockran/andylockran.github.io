<p>Those eagle-eyed views of this site will have noticed that I've not been so good at my running recently.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting for the 'right' time to start, I've already started, and I intend to continue my 5k every other day.</p>
<p>I don't particularly like it at the moment, but I imagine that's because I'm not running fit - and as I get fitter I anticipate I'll like it more.</p>
<p>It's a hard slog getting back into it, but hopefully we'll start to see the positives.</p>
