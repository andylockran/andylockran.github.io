<p><a title="Vote on Hard Shoulders" href="http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7061188.stm?dynamic_vote=ON#vote_hard_shoulders">This article</a> came to my attention today, not so much for its content, but for the opinions of the users.</p>
<p>According to the beeb, (at the time of writing,) 55.1% of people who voted were not comfortable with the idea of driving along the hard shoulder.  After a trial on the M42, it's going to be rolled out on the M6 too.</p>
<p>I quite like driving on the hard shoulder.</p>
