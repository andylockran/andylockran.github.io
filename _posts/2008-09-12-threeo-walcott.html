<p>It's quite a catchy headline.. not mine unfortunately.</p>
<p>I was umming and ahhing about whether to do a blog on the England game.  I've decided not to - as there's so much prose elsewhere for people to read.  If you want my take - come down the pub in Manchester and we'll discuss it over pints of England's finest Ales.</p>
