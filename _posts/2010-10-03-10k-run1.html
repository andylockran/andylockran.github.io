<p>Today I took part in the Heaton Park, Cancer Research UK, 10K run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having woken up at 7am, I supped on lots of Lucozade and had a banana. &nbsp;Awesome start to the day. Looking out the window, it was chucking it down with rain. &nbsp;I know Manchester hasn't got the best reputation when it comes to fine weather, but today was probably the wettest for months. &nbsp;I drove over and picked up Daniel &amp; Jenna, then headed over to Heaton Park.</p>
<p>When we got there, despite the delay in finding a place to park, we made it to the field in time for one last 'toilet stop' and joined in the amusing warm up. &nbsp;By the end of this we were absolutely drenched from the rain above, and squelching from the mud below. &nbsp;I was so glad to have bought myself a pair of tight-fitting running socks the day before.</p>
<p>The run started, and after 5 minutes of jogging in a fairly tight pack through narrow paths (and lots of mud) the field started to break up and I had the opportunity to overtake a few of the more casual joggers. &nbsp;The run took us over bog and quagmire, and despite a puddle only being about 3 inches deep and 5 meters long on the way out, the torrential rain meant that running back through the same path on the 8km mark, it was 50 meters long and up to 6-8 inches deep in places. &nbsp;I didn't apply to run a triathalon, but it wasn't far off being able to swim!</p>
<p>I got to the last km and was starting to feel it. &nbsp;The penultimate 500 metres seemed to go on forever, and on the 500 meter mark I got overtaken by a guy who'd picked up his pace. &nbsp;Not feeling like I had much in the tank, I didn't want to keep pace with him, but figured it would be a sensible thing for me to do. &nbsp;I'm glad I did, because along the finishing straight I saw the clock, and wanting to finish under 54 minutes, I managed to find the energy to break into a sprint. &nbsp;I passed him with seconds to spare, and finished in 53 minutes 43 seconds.</p>
<p>It was a tough race, the weather persisted down throughout the whole of the race. &nbsp;However, I really enjoyed it, and the sense of achievement at the end of it was much more acute than I'd expected.</p>
<p>Training for this has been fun, and having not run much before I'm looking forward to the next chance I have to get out and compete in another 10k. &nbsp;I don't think I'll be increasing the distance in the next few months, but hopefully will get a chance to improve upon my time, and run in nicer weather.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who sponsored me; it carried me through knowing I had support - and I'm glad that the money raised is going to such a great cause as Cancer Research.</p>
