<p>Format wars... who needs them?</p>
<p>Not I.  I have an xbox360 - but should I get a HD-DVD drive for it?</p>
<p>I'm sure once one format reaches perceived critical mass then the support for the other will drop.  I'm going to be a little irresponsible as I'm not fully aware of the technical deficiencies/advantages of the one format over the other.. but I like the box on the blu-ray disc more than the HD-DVD - and as it seems to be the way the format war is going I'm going to lend my voice to the blu-ray camp.</p>
<p>It's not that I'm at all informed on the issue - it's that I believe it's best to get the format out of the door as fast as possible and make it a dominant format.  We can then progress.</p>
<p>Please join me in supporting blu-ray to end the format war before anyone gets hurt :)</p>
