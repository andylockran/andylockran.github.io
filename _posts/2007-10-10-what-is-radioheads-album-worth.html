<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7037194.stm">BBC NEWS | Entertainment | What is Radiohead's album worth?</a></p>
<p>It's a very bad article - which goes to show what lengths the musicians are going to have to go to in order to break free from their record labels.</p>
<p>If you can't be bothered to read the whole article, I'll summarized the key point I wanted to go over below:</p>
<p>"<font size="2">The record company signed the band in the first place, developed them and brought them to our attention. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">So maybe I should have paid £4.91 to Radiohead and sent a cheque for the other half to EMI for its part in Radiohead's career, and to pay for finding the next Radiohead."</font></p>
<p>That's nice isn't it.  Following the same logic, one could say, lets pay this journalist £2 an hour... let's pay his previous companies for 'developing his talent' and lets pay his parents for 'teaching him to read and write.'</p>
<p>What a silly man.</p>
<p>The music business is changing, faster than they would like to admit.  The big record labels are nothing more than marketing tools now.  If a good producer can get his hands on some talent (and there's plenty of it on magnatune) then quality albums can be make without the need of a label.  As Radiohead showed earlier today - distribution isn't really a factor.</p>
<p>It's a shame that journalists have to go and pee on someone elses bonfire. I just hope this particular one had something to do with a phoney call-in and will be leaving the BBC faster than a blue peter presenter can say 'Cuddles'.. (or was it Cookie?)</p>
