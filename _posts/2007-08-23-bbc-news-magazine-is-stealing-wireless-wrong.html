<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6960304.stm">BBC NEWS | Magazine | Is stealing wireless wrong?</a></p>
<p>My position on this is that if the access point is open then it may be freely used.  There are an increasingly common number of free hot-spots over the UK.  Imagine if you were using Bristol wireless but moved too close to a Wurzel's unsecured home network.  You'd be breaking the law through no fault of your own.  It's about time people took responsibility - if a network point is open - it's free for anyone to use.  If you don't like it - then secure it.</p>
<p>What do people in the know think? (I'm guessing my readership would have some good opinions on this.)</p>
