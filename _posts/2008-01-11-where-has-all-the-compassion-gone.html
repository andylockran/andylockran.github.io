<p><strong>From the BBC:</strong><br />
<blockquote>
<blockquote><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7182467.stm"><em><font size="2"><strong>A terminally-ill Ghanaian woman who was forced to return home after her UK visa expired is struggling to receive the medical treatment she needs.</strong></font></em></a></p></blockquote>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>It's stories like this that really get me worried.  It's when accountants get to decide whether or not to keep someone alive.</p>
<p>I understand that the NHS can't support everyone in the world; but people who have come to Britain, especially those that have <em>had</em> a British Visa - whether or not they've actually done any work while they've been across here should be offered our arms of compassion.</p>
<p>Nor do I like the opinion that sure - she's got a visa so she must have contributed tax - therefore let her stay.  this sets a bad precedent.  If you've not paid the tax for your treatement, do you not deserve that treatment?  I'm currently "in debt" massively to the NHS if that's the case.</p>
<p>The NHS isn't a pay-your-way system like the Health Insurance setup in the USA.  Whilst you may also claim it's a two tier system in the UK - often private insurance doesn't cover Cancer.  Even the richest therefore rely on the NHS to provide their cancer care.  They also rely on the NHS for emergency cover.  When the chips are down - everyone is equal.  There weren't people queuing up after 7/7 in London saying  "Private insurance this way, private care over here!"</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to really look hard at the policies in place.  I understand that we cannot pay indefinite amounts to prevent someone from dying -  unless there's a realistic chance of recovery and 'wellness,' the figure quoted for the Maximum cost-per-person-per-annum is £50K.  Anymore that that and the switch is cut off.

<p>However, in Ghanian hospitals, this womans treatment would cost ~£12,000 a year.  It's well under the £50K limit - and it's another life sustained by the fantastic NHS.</p>
<p>I'd be dead were it not for the NHS - would you?</p>
