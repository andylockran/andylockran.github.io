<p>I <strike>have blogged</strike> thought I had blogged about the <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/">Berkely Open Infrastructure Networked Computing (BOINC)</a> Project before, but it appears I haven't.The BBC ran a big project on the network called "ClimatePrediction.net."   When your computer is turned on, the program uses either your processor when it's 'idle' or you can configure it to use a percentage even while your working to process data.  This data is downloaded from a central respository, and there are thousands of computers connected all doing their own little bit.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, hiring on of the big IBM machines to run such experiments isn't an option, so along with Google's clusters, <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/">BOINC</a> aims to give organisations that wouldn't have the chance of accessing such high computational power the chance - by letting the people choose.</p>
<p>If you download <a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/" title="BOINC">BOINC</a>, you can choose what projects you want to help with.  Me, being a geek, first got on board with the SETI@Home project, which was originally an independent distributed network - but due to it's success spawned BOINC.</p>
<p><a href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/" title="BOINC">BOINC</a> has been going for a few years now, and it's something I've been dipping in and out of since it first began.</p>
<p>One of the projects I've been interested in (and contributing time to) was the Protein Folding Experiment.  I got an email off the administrator today:<br />
<blockquote>
<pre>In the period before the summer, more than 15,000<br />volunteers participated in the Proteins@Home project.<br />I would like to thank all of you for your overwhelming<br />support. My warm thanks also go to the BOINC development<br />and testing community.<br /><br />Thanks to you, we were able to make significant scientific<br />contributions to the protein folding problem and to protein<br />structure prediction methods. Our first publications are<br />just becoming available: see, eg,<br /><a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/117860966/ABSTRACT" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/117860966/ABSTRACT</a><br />A book on distributed computing will also appear in 2008,<br />with a chapter describing Proteins@Home:<br />Distributed &amp; Grid Computing -- Science Made Transparent<br />for Everyone. Principles, Applications and Supporting<br />Communities, Tektum Publishers, Berlin.<br /><br />In the last few months, thanks to the Proteins@Home<br />results, we have considerably improved our prediction<br />method and are beginning to apply it to specific protein<br />families such as the Src homology domains and so-called<br />WW domains. This will help us identify new members of<br />these families and understand the function of newly-<br />discovered genes. More information is in the attached<br />report.<br /><br />With our improved methodology in place, we are ready<br />for a new computation phase. We hope that you will<br />participate in this new phase.</pre>
