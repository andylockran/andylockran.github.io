<p>This is my take on the Drabble meme, from <a href="http://www.netsplit.com/2009/02/26/drabble-contest-the-siege/">Scott James Remnant</a></p>
<p>A drabble, simply put, is a story, normally science fiction or fantasy that is <em>exactly</em> one hundred (100) words in length.  No more, no less.</p>
<p>To participate, all you have to do is write a story in 100 words and post it on your blog.</p>
<p>This is my attempt, entitled <strong>"The Void"</strong><br />
<br />
<blockquote>Finally the lid was lifted.<br />
<br />Nothing could be seen in the darkness.<br />
<br />Drip, drip drip.<br />
<br />Footsteps could be heard from beyond the now passable void; were they human feet?<br />
<br />“Sam,” he shouted. “Come hither.”<br />
<br />At once Sam was there, trembling in the cold and damp.<br />
<br />“You're the only one that can fit through, Sam.”<br />
<br />Sam held her breath, and ducked down past the rubble.<br />
<br />The air was pungent with the smell.<br />
<br />Sam entered the void, and at once realised the enormity of the task that lay ahead.<br />
<br />“We're going to need dyno-rod to fix this leak!”</p></blockquote>
