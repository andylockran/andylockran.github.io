<p>I had a bit of a revelation this morning.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I produced a video to be shown at a Conference in the UK, for a few hundred people.  I'd never produced a video before, yet through the wonderful world of free software and Creative Commons, I was able to produce a decent enough effort.  The music that I used was licenses under a CC license, allowing for dstribution and reuse - so that the people I made the video for can take excerpts without having to break the law.</p>
<p>I've now been asked to make a video to be shown at my old secondary school, which is going to require a different soundtrack, and possibly a different focus.  Over the next year, I'm going to be generating loads of audiovisual content, and was looking for a good way to make sure that this content could be used to help stoke an interest in the injustice faced by many of the future subjects of my photographs.</p>
<p>I wathced a talk given @ #Ted (TED2009 started today!) by Bono.  That "Rock Musician with a cause."  He observed that the problem in Africa isn't an issue of charity, but an issue of justice.  Charity is about regaining the status quo, bringing people up to a level.  Justice is about allowing people the chance to survive.</p>
<p>It was this tenous music link that set me up with my latest idea.</p>
<p>#tweetband</p>
<p>The first stage is to get the basic layout of a song.  ABACAB I think is a fairly universal layout, and a nice simple one to start with.  I therefore need a chord progression for:</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>Once that's done, we can set a time signature and tempo (I think we should go for something simple to start with, like 4/4 and 120bpm).</p>
<p>Then, we get a few people to contribute some lyrics.</p>
<p>Once this is all done, people can go away, and record bits of the song on however many instruments they like, and send me each track.  I will then mix them all together and add photos to create a streaming video.</p>
<p>It's worth a try, so if anyone can get the ball rolling, just use the #tweetband tag on twitter, get people seeing the idea, and let's get the ball rolling!</p>
