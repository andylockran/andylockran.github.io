<p><a href="http://blog.zrmt.com/index.php/2007/12/17/so-i-phoned-adobe/">A while back I wrote about the adobe flash player EULA.</a></p>
<p>It was a while ago, so I wasn't expecting a response anytime soon.  I got one today:<br />
<blockquote> Thank you for contacting Adobe Customer Services.</p>
<p>Regarding your question about using Flash player with a Linux OS on a Tablet PC:</p>
<p>This is a legal restiction rather than a technical restriction. You are advised to abide by the terms of the EULA as stated below.</p>
<p>3.1  Web Player Prohibited Devices. You may not Use any Web Player on any non-PC device or with any embedded or device version of any operating system. For the avoidance of doubt, and by example only, you may not use a Web Player on any (a) mobile devices, set top boxes (STB), handhelds, phones, web pads, tablets and Tablet PCs that are not running Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, game consoles, TVs, DVD players, media centers (excluding Windows XP Media Center Edition and its successors), electronic billboards or other digital signage, internet appliances or other internet-connected devices, PDAs, medical devices, ATMs, telematic devices, gaming machines, home automation systems, kiosks, remote control devices, or any other consumer electronics device, (b) operator-based mobile, cable, satellite, or television systems or (c) other closed system devices.</p>
<p>We are still investigating this issue and we may contact you if we need to communicate any further information.</p>
<p>Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,</p></blockquote>
<p>If you take a look at the original post, I did not question as to why it wasn't allowed; I questioned as to why they word the EULA to prohibit its usage.  It may be a <em>legal reason</em> but until Adobe can provide a definitive reason (other than, it's in the EULA) - then I won't be satisfied.  The case continues...</p>
