<p>Just to let regular readers know - I've decided to start adding a little bit of poetry to the 'blog.  It'll nothing special I'm sure - just something I'm going to put out there from time to time.</p>
<p>If you don't want that kind of stuff on your planets - let me know and I'll have to change the tag I'm subscribed to the planet under.   </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
