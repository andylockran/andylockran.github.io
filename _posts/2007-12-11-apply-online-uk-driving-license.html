<p>I've just had to reapply for a replacement driving license after my last one was lost/stolen.  I lost the photocard bit in a wallet I mislaid over the summer - and it's taken til now for me to get round to replacing it.</p>
<p>What an experience.  I recall <a href="http://www.petesodyssey.org/node/151" title="Pete's Blog">this blog</a> by Pete Lewis on his good experiences of the NHS IT program.</p>
<p>Well I've got to say my experience of the Driving License Online Application was also very pleasant.  Aside from the site being down for maintenance when I originally attempted to apply last week, I had a rather uneventful and successful application.</p>
<p>I just hope they don't now post my application to Coventry....  there's been enough lost mail recently.</p>
