<p>I have a nice Music Library of all my CDs encoded in the *.flac format.  I like it, so I don't want to get rid of it.</p>
<p>However, Mr. iPod doesn't like it - so I want to keep a mirror of my Music Library in the *.mp3 file format.</p>
<p>I'm not much cop at bash scripting.. but here's a shell of what I've got so far. (music-convertor.sh)<br />
<blockquote>
<blockquote> #!/bin/sh<br />##Andy Loughran<br />##Mirror .flac library to mp3</p>
<p>for i in ~/Music/*/*.flac;<br />do lame -b 192 "$i";<br />mkdir ~/mp3Music/"$(pwd)"/;<br />mv *.mp3 ~/mp3Music/"$(pwd)";<br />done</p></blockquote>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn't work yet - but that's my immediate comprehension of the sort of thing I'd like.</p>
<p>I would quite like it to rsync the library - so only encode the new files.. I guess this could be done by getting a list of all the files in each directory and just diffing the two to get the new files.. but there's bound to be a better way.</p>
<p>Therefore some questions -</p>
<p>Should I be using bash-scripting to do this.. is it an efficient use of resources, and if so can anyone provide me with a way that works..?</p>
<p>Is there a utility that already does this?</p>
