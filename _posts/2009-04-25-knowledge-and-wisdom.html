<p>I really haven't written as much as I'd intended over the last few weeks, but bear with me please.  I think there'll be plenty of blogs coming out in the future which will reflect on the experiences that  I've been having out here.</p>
<p>I don't think it's possible to regurgitate the actual events happening out here, as  every day different things happen - and in order to respectfully cover each of the events as stand-alone entities, I'd probably need to be writing all the time.  What I can do instead is reflect on where I find myself now.</p>
<p>Being in a different culture for a length of time has been a new experience for me, especially one so different back home - sometimes in subtle, but very profound ways.  I'm really enjoying my time out here, but the variety of emotions seems to be much higher than back home - both good and bad.</p>
<p>One of the things that I've really enjoyed, is that I feel as though I'm using my full self to do the work.  If you were to imagine my skillset as a pie chart, in the past I've felt that only certain slices were being used to function.  When these slices had been eaten, I still had more slices to  give - but as they weren't relevant to the task I faced, I'd have to wait until the slices were recharged before continuing.  Out here I feel as though all the slices are being eaten, though whilst some are recharging, I am able to use the others to help fulfil the overall aim.</p>
<p>The last camp we did was for a group of children who we've yet to see for medical assessments; all the other camps we've done the medicals had been done in that area before holding the camp.  As a result, we were faced with many undiagnosed medical issues - one being a broken arm which had been treated by the ayravedic doctor by being rubbed in herbs and then bandaged up.  It was  clearly set in the wrong position, and would now require further operations to fix.</p>
<p>Here, Ayravedic medicine is seen as an equal alternative to western medicine, yet for things like broken bones, using it ahead of Western Medicine is clearly not a sensible method - however, some people are forced into using Ayravedic Doctors, as the western methods are more expensive.</p>
<p>So much has been happening that it's sometimes hard to sit down and reflect, and there's also issues of patient confidentiality that I have to keep to.  However, there are lots of children in need so your help would be appreciated.  I'll soon write an article on 'Kidz Haven'  - so that you can see what the plan is for the next few years in India.</p>
