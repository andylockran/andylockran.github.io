<p>A few years back, my diabetic aunt had her life changed by a double transplant of Pancreas and Kidney.   This was only possible thanks to the kindness and premeditated actions of some kind person to sign on to the organ donor register.</p>
<p>When you die, you don't leave behind a body for people to remember - you leave behind a legacy.  The body is no longer of use to you.</p>
<p>I urge those of you who've not yet done so to sign the register - and become an organ donor.  In the cold light of day, your organs may be used to save more than one life.. what a fantastic dying wish.</p>
