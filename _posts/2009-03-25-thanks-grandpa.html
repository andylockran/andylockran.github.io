<p>I arrived back in India at 3.30 local time this morning, and immediately realised I'd made the right decision.  I left Heathrow @ 9.20 on Tuesday morning, and once I was in the air and away from the UK the burden of work was lifted from my shoulders.  It was a good feeling.</p>
<p>The night before my flight, I went with my Dad and brother to "Chimes Restaurant" near where my Dad's flat is.  It's a charming little English restaurant, and the three of us enjoyed a great meal - and John managed to beat my Dad to the bill whilst he went for a short break to the little boys room.  I think he liked that.</p>
<p>One of the things I was most looking forward to on the trip out to India is that money has been raised for a Jeep-like vehicle to transport the doctors and myself for use as a traveling clinic.  The vehicle is so integral to the mid-term future of the project, that it was great to find out 4 weeks ago that the funding had been met.</p>
<p>Last night I found out that the funding which came in 4 weeks ago was from someone I knew very well, my Grandpa.  Unfortunately in October he passed away, but he'd left money in his will and despite no family involvement, it's ended up being used on a vehicle that I'm going to be using.</p>
<p>It's these kind of small coincidences that really make me think that the right decision has been made in me coming out here.</p>
<p>Thanks Grandpa!</p>
