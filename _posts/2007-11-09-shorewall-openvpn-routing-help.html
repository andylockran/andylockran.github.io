<p>12:24 &lt; andylockran&gt; hey guys<br />12:24 &lt; andylockran&gt; I need some help as I haven't yet identified the problem, so can't look for a solution.<br />12:25 &lt; andylockran&gt; I'm trying to get two identical server clusters replicating over openvpn.  As they're "identical" I<br />want to keep them with the same ip addresses.  In order to avoid IP conflict, port forwarding is set up<br />for the replication.<br />12:26 &lt; andylockran&gt; On cluster 1, db forwards it's ldap port to the firewall machine (which is one end of hte vpn) and the<br />same happens at the other end on the second cluster.<br />12:27 &lt; andylockran&gt; However, for this two work, the opposing clients need to be able to see the other firewall machine (the<br />two vpn ip addresses)<br />12:27 &lt; andylockran&gt; both db can see their own fw machine's ip.. but not the other<br />12:27 &lt; andylockran&gt; can you tell me if it's a routing, or bridging problem.  or whether what I'm trying to do is<br />incompatible with openvpn?</p>
