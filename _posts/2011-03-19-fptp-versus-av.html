<p>I logged onto facebook earlier and a poll popped up on the right hand side - which sport could you not live without?</p>
<ul>
<li>Football</li>
<li>Rugby</li>
<li>Cricket</li>
</ul>
<p>I selected Rugby - and the following were the results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Football - 73%</li>
<li>Rugby - 18%</li>
<li>Cricket - 9%</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it was limited to the three sports, Rugby includes the League/Union split, and there are probably many other options.  I'd hypothesis though, that Cricket is the second favourite sport of Rugby Fans and Football fans.  Therefore moving the poll to an AV setup, rather than the FPTP that it is currently - would provide an interesting insight - and probably move cricket above Rugby - but not affect Football?</p>
<p>There's only one way to find out - and that is to run the poll and get the stats for both answers.  I won't delude myself and pretend I can get enough readers of this blog to vote in order to generate a fair sample - so instead can anyone devise a method of collecting this information that would get us a fair sample?</p>
