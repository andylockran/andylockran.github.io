<p>I contemplated writing a poem.<br />
<br />I tried to make it rhyme - it didn't.<br />
<br />I tried to make it be something clever - it wasn't.<br />
<br />I tried to make it say something profound - it failed.<br />
<br />I tried to make it so that other people would want to read it - they wouldn't.<br />
<br />I wrote to fulfil my need to write - it didn't.<br />
<br />I don't think I'm good at poetry.<br />
<br />Do you?</p>
