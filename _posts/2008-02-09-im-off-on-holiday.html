<p>Ah man.. It took some time to make this decision - but I've decided on my course of action.</p>
<p>I'm off on holiday from Saturday 9th, until Sunday 17th Feb.  I'm going skiing in the French Alps, and despite their being an internet connection - think it's best if I don't blog for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Hopefully it'll provide people with a nice break from my post on the relative planets - and hopefully wanting more when I return.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to my break, as I feel I need to go and recharge my batteries.  Working in the open source world isn't a normal 9-5.  Many times I've been up past two doing random 'generic' FLOSS stuff - and it's taken it's toll.  I'll probably have to start keeping timesheets for my general activities to stop me from going overboard.</p>
<p>If anyone has anything they'd like me to cover when I return - it'd be good to have some direction for when I get back.</p>
<p>I hope anyone else going on Holiday has a good time, and those of you at work - just wait until you're on holiday and I'm not.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
