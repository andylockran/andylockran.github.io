<p>Guys,<br />I hope that there are enough people that read this blog, or read other blogs of people that read this blog in order to help find the poor girl Madeleine McCann.</p>
<p>Today, it is her fourth birthday, and as you can see from the news, her parents must be find it so hard to cope.</p>
<p>Recently, a small button appeared to support the missing Alan Johnson is Iraq - and I thought it would be a good idea to create a similar one for Madeleine, to show our support for her search.</p>
<p>If you want to put the code on your site, <a href="http://www.zrmt.com/maddy.txt">click here</a> to download the code.</p>
<p>This will put the following image<br /><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/findmaddyti1.png" alt="Madeleine" />
<p>onto your site, with a hyperlink to Madeleine's search at http://www.ceop.gov.uk if you click on it.If you can make a better button, please do.. but it is purely the demonstration of support that is important.</p>
<p>God Bless Madeleine and let's all pray for her safe return.</p>
