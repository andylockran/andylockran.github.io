<p>It's been quite an exciting day for me today.  Since I have been up, I've moved my African glass catfish out of the tank that my badis-badis eggs are in, so that there will be no mistakes with bigger fish eating the fry.  There is a real sense of excitement developing in the tank.  With approximately two days left until the fry hatch, the females are being chased around the tank by a rather colourful male badis-badis.</p>
<p>His role in the birth and hatching of the fry is to protect them.  As shown on the previous blog, I placed an upturned plantpot (with a hole put in it by my own fair hand) into the sand, so that the females would have somewhere to place the eggs.  I'm 100% sure that this part of the breeding process is complete, with some of the females tummys looking rather smaller than they did two days ago.</p>
<p>The male guards the pot to make sure that no-one interferes with the eggs - you can see him sticking his head out in the photo below.</p>

<p>I will hopefully be able to update you with more pictures as I can take them.  If anyone fancies a particular photo being taken of the fish (such as one of the females .etc), please leave a comment and I'll try to take a half-decent one for the blog.</p>
