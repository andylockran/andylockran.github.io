<p>Just over a week ago, Pete Lewis and I set up a blog aggregator @ <a href="http://dev.zrmt.com" title="ZRMT">http://dev.zrmt.com.</a>  We initially populated it with a few blogs that we knew of around the Birmingham Area (mostly people from <a href="http://sb.lug.org.uk">SB LUG</a> and a few other places.   At the start of the week, we decided to move it across to BrumSpace.org.</p>
<p>The main reason behind this was that we wanted to do something that was more than just blogging.  Having been able to read a number of Birmingham Blogs all in the same place - it made me realise that there's lots more to a BrumSpace than just the blogs.  Twitter is a fantastic medium which is really starting to take off.. like everyone's hidden mistress.  There's also Plings - which is a site I've recently discovered thanks to a tip-off from a colleague.  It's aiming to be an event-driven-twitter-thing as far as I can tell.  Looking at their 'labs' page shows they're trying to integrate with twitter rather than replicate it - so watch that space!</p>
<p>The bloggers meet-up this evening was really nice.  It was good to meet so many interesting people.  As I'm fairly new to the blogging community here, I could do with some online introductions.  I've met some bloggers offline before even meeting them online - how weird! If you were at the meeting, add me on twitter here = <a href="http://twitter.com/andylockran">andylockran</a>.</p>
<p>It was also good to meet some of the guys who I've spoken to a fair bit on IRC/Mailing Lists, such as Pete, Zeth and Dan.  Looking forward to the next one - when I'll hopefully be able to put more blogs to names to faces :)</p>
