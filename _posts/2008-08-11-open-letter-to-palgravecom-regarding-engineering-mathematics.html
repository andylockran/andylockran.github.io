<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>Having recently purchase 'Engineering Mathematics' - 5th Edition, I was  disappointed to find that the companion CD contained software that would  only work with Windows, and not on my Ubuntu Laptop, or Mac Desktop.</p>
<p>Despite Microsoft having held a seemingly unassailable market share over  the past 20 years on the Desktop, current trends show that more and more  people are using Mac OSX and Linux on the desktop - with Linux being  particularly strong in certain academic fields.</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest that palgrave do not release a 'Mac OSX version',  nor an 'Ubuntu version' of the personal tutor; but anticipate the  current market trends and put the personal tutor 'in the cloud.'  This  would enable you to centrally-manage updates and revisions to the tutor,  rather than having to 'push' updates to your customers.  It would also  enable you to leverage the intelligence of the 'community' of  'Engineering Mathematics' readers since its first publication in 1970.</p>
<p>I won't preach toward you about the benefits of choosing "open source  software" as your platform (although do take a look at moodle for your  Virtual Learning Environment).  However, I'd like to place emphasis on  the potential of the 'community' that such a website would create.    Instead of having students as independent satellites, you'd bring them  together online to encourage collaboration and solutions.</p>
<p>These are the skills that the academic community are trying to  encourage.  It was Tim Berners-Lee, of the academic community, who  started the World Wide Web at CERN.  Please consider contributing yourselves.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
