<p>In recent weeks, there have been a few posts dotted around my little corner of the blogosphere regarding photography.  Evidently taking photos of the police is now illegal as they could be used by terrorists.  That argument sounds pants, is pants, and is yet brought into law - and has been so since the 16th February 2009.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, I wrote a blog on how I'd taken a few photos of firefighters dealing with an incident <a href="http://blog.zrmt.com/2009/01/27/manchester-fire-great-ancoats-street/">@ Sarah Tower in Mancheter.</a> It turned out to by my most successful blog, and my friend Andrew Reid (who'd taken the photos) had them published on the BBC News Official Website, and then used on North West Tonight (the BBC's local news in the North West).  We had a few pictures with firemen in, a fair bit of smoke - and they provided a good little snapshot of the fire.</p>
<p>Since then, I've taken my digital camera everywhere with me.  Testament to what I'm hoping to acheive out in India - documenting anything from the banal to the eventful is something which has far more 'power' when there's a photo associated.  No one would have bothered to read my blog for my view on the fire - to be honest, no one probably cares for my view. However, having the photos here made people come, and once they were here they may have spent two minutes reading the story.</p>
<p>Tonight, I found out that Dave Walker had been walking his dog down in Devon - and happened upon a Police Incident with a few Police Cars and an Ambulance in attendance.  Since he was carrying a camera, the Police stopped him and asked him to show them his camera so that he could prove he'd taken no photos of the police - as well as his name and address.</p>
<p>I find this story to be yet another example of the subversive methods that are being used by authority in order to get more control.  Actions like these reduce confidence in the police to 'serve and protect' - and instead make the average citizen view them as authoritarian.  I find it is a sad indictment of the 'developed civilisations' that the people in power are having to regress the average man's civil liberties - but for what ends?</p>
<p>I'm not sure on the latter.  I think speculation on this is what moves us from the realm of fact into the realm of conspiracy theory.  The fact that people are prevented from photographing the police is fact.  There can be no two ways about it.  However - this law is so open to abuse that's it's increidbly 'un-funny.'<br />
