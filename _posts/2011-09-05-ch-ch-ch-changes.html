<p>It's been a while since I last wrote, but alot has changed since I was last here.  </p>
<p>I've moved from Manchester and relocated back to Birmingham; this was to help out with the <a href="http://www.beesrugby.com">Birmingham and Solihull Bees</a>, as well as to give myself a little bit more time at the weekends. Most of last season had been spent travelling up and down the M6 and even the home games were two hours away.  We're two games into the season, and I've not managed to make it to a game yet.. that will change on Saturday.</p>
<p>As for my new employment, I'm now working at Mobile Fun and absolutely love it.  Mobile Fun specialise in selling <a href="http://www.mobilefun.co.uk">Mobile Phone Accessories</a> and are a fast growing company.  I was attracted to the position due to the ability to learn not just about the workings of a medium sized enterprise - but to give myself a challenge.  I'd had five very happy years at Zednax, but I felt it was time to move on and set myself a new challenge.</p>
<p>As for the site itself - I'm pretty impressed with the development that is done at MF.  There's a great IT team, and my skills at TableFootball are much improved since starting.  There's loads of work to do - it's an exciting time in a customer-facing business with the challenges of the current economic climate, and there's so much going on.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying the new challenge, and hopefully I'll have some more interesting stuff to share over the coming months.</p>
