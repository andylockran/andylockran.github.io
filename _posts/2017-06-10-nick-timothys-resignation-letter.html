<p>Having read through Nick Timothy's resignation letter [<a href="http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2017/06/nick-timothy-why-i-have-resigned-as-the-prime-ministers-adviser.html">read it here</a>], this really stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>because modern campaigning techniques require ever-narrower targeting of specific voters, and we were not talking to the people who decided to vote for Labour.</p></blockquote>
<p>This implies modern campaigning is about winning, about getting power, about putting your party ahead of the country.</p>
<p>When we look at the millions spent on campaigns, these are no longer used to broadly inform on policy, but have a very simple target in mind - to swing a vote; potentially even on just a single issue. Â Now that we have this capability, is it ethically or morally right to fight an election with such a narrow strategy in mind; or should the manifesto have a more prominent place, making sure that all votes are ensured of a fuller context to their decision, rather than gamified with single issue targeting?</p>
