<p>When running with friends, more often than not someone has a brain fart and forgets to un-pause their app, the battery runs out or running under a bridge means that the route gets some weird artefacts.</p>
<p>Rather than try and play around with the results, I like to just borrow a friend's data and use it - however, when running with Karly I kept on having to manually strip out the HRM and Cadence data from her gpx files.</p>
<p>Since I'm probably not the only guy that does this, I've setup a little tool for you to do it to. Please try it out @ <a href="http://gpxstrip.herokuapp.com/">http://gpxstrip.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
