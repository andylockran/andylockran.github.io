<p>I think it's about time that people became aware of the advantages of the GnuPrivacyGuard.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7409593.stm">According the to BBC</a> the government are considering keeping a database of every phone call made and every email sent.  Now, it's already possible to do this with your current email communications - and very few people bother to encrypt their mail to make sure that only the recipient can read it.</p>
<p>Email passes over a network in plain text - thereby anything sent in a email is easy to 'sniff' out and read.  With gpg - you encrypt the mail with a password - then the only person that can read the mail is the person that knows that password.. the recipient of the email.</p>
<p>It's a clever system, so <a title="Red Hat GPG" href="http://www.redhat.com/magazine/006apr05/features/gpg/">here's a link to Red Hat Magazine's article on GPG</a>.</p>
<p>For a Windows-based solution, try <a title="gpg4Win" href="http://www.gpg4win.org/">WinGPG</a>.</p>
<p>If we can't change the system, then we at least need to protect ourselves from it.</p>
