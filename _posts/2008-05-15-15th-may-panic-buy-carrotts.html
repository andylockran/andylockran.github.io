<p>It's a little bit funny.  On facebook a couple of months ago, <span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/s.php?k=100000080&amp;id=515462245">Freya Valentine</a> </span> started <a title="Facebook Group" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=9801981146">this group</a>.  It's not the most exciting of ideas, but has generated a bit of a cult following.  It's been mentioned on <a title="Sky Article" href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30100-1302697,00.html">Sky</a> &amp; the BBC's Steve Wright Show.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to hear on how the Panic buying is getting along, therefore suggested setting up a twit-feed to monitor it - however, twitter has been down for the last couple of hours.</p>
<p>Just goes to show that a de-centralised system is needed.  A free, open source, de-centralised mechanism for twittering.</p>
<p>Oh well, I'll just have to remain ignorant, and enjoy my carrot soup.</p>
