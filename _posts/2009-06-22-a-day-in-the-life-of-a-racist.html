<p>The racist arrives home from work in an German car. He opens his front door, made from Indonesian wood, and goes to his Italian fridge for a Danish beer. He sits down on his Swedish sofa, turns on his Japanese television, to watch a football match on an American owned channel. His team includes players from Argentina, South Korea and Nigeria, is owned by a Russian and managed by a Spaniard. Finally, he picks up his mobile phone from Finland, orders an Indian meal made with lamb from New Zealand and rice from China and pays for it with money held in a Dutch bank.</p>
<p><strong>Think.</strong></p>
<p>Before you even ate breakfast this morning, you depended on half the world.</p>
