<p>I was pretty impressed when I heard about <a title="Movember" href="http://www.movember.com/">Movember</a> - a competition which begins with a shave on the 31st October, followed by a month-long growing marathon, and topped off with a local event in your area.</p>
<p>Being a bit 'off the path' in India, I was already growing a Mo, and it turns out I did it just at the right time to help kick-start a friend's team's 'Movember' build-up.</p>
<p>Take a look <a title="Here" href="http://allthatmo.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/50-raised/">here</a>!</p>
<p>Of course there is a serious issue behind all this baloney.  It's about raising the awareness in Men that they need to care about their health too - hopefully by reading this it'll make you think twice about your own health.. so GROW THAT MO! and setup your team.  Ubuntu teams would be nice, as I already know a few facial hair growers.. just beware of BEARD DANDRUFF!!</p>
