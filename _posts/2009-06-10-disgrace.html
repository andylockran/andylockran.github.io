<p>I drive along the urban roads,<br />
<br />The bustle of town mixed with Radio 2.</p>
<p>I see people walking around; enjoying the day.<br />
<br />Some are working - busy under the blue sky.</p>
<p>An angry driver beeps me, ignoring the red light.</p>
<p>Disgraceful.. I have to abide by the law<br />
<br />I think.. do i?<br />
<br />Should I speed, can I<br />
<br />Get away with it?<br />
<br />Reminded of the consequences of my actions and looking back<br />
<br />Ashamed that I too would speed, the very act that hurt me<br />
<br />Close.. I came more than close to it. Yet<br />
<br />Even I would do it</p>
