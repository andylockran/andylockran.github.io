<p>I think one of the hardest thing to process right now is probably this:</p>
<p>The vast majority of my network supported ‪#‎remain‬, I could only influence people who already shared my views.</p>
<p>In reacting to the vote, you may be ashamed and confused about how anyone you know could vote the opposite way. Don't cut them off, don't cut them out.</p>
<p>We need to understand why they've made these decisions, and equip ourselves with knowledge to challenge and convince them, not build walls and claim intellectual superiority because we think we are right and they are wrong.</p>
<p>Leaving the EU is a huge decision, with indirect ramifications that are truly ugly. To pick an example from across the pond. No one ever thought Trump would get popular support for his "Deport all Muslims" policy, but here we are a few months later with him dangerously close to the American Presidency.</p>
<p>As disappointed as i feel about the EU result, should Farage and his right wing pals want to seek a mandate to support Trump with another referendum; I don't want to be going to sleep that night with the thought of feeling as disappointed as I did on the 24th June 2016.</p>
<p>Politics isn't just about voting. It's not a choice for us to engage once a year, it's about selecting people we admire and respect to represent our ideals, to let them make decisions on our behalf and to watch them be a shining example for our beliefs.</p>
<p>Go back out to your communities; love not hate. This one may be lost, but we now have to better make our case.</p>
