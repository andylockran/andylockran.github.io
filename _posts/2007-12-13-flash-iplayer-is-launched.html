<p>Well it's only another piece of the deal, and I will no doubt be updating the blog over the next few days on the fundamentals - but here's some good news for OSX/Linux users.  iPlayer will now work with Flash on your system.  GNU users may not be so happy.  I haven't tested it with gnash yet... so could someone let me know if that works?</p>
<p>Here's the URL. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer</a>  not bad quality either!</p>
<p>Many thanks to the efforts of the BBC team, Becky Hogge (The Open Rights Group) and Gerry Gavigan (The Open Source Consortium) - and anyone else involved in the iPlayer development / petitioning.</p>
