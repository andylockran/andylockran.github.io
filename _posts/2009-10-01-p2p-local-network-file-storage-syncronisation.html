<p>I thought I'd put this one out to the blog to see if anyone can offer me advice.</p>
<p>I'm trying to work out the best way to share files between 2 Macs, 1 Ubuntu box, and 3 XP machines. </p>
<p>Initially, I thought a central NAS drive would make sense, however, because of the need for backup (and the lack of a decent internet connection) - backing up remotely is going to be too costly.</p>
<p>My next thought was that the clients should sync the NAS locally, as to avoid disaster should the NAS be unavailable/broken.  I'm using Ubuntu ONE - and something like this would be useful, providing I could run it on my local network w/out internet connection.</p>
<p>I've also looked at iFolder (by Novell) but haven't got time to waste trying to get it to work and play nice.. </p>
<p>So if anyone can offer me some advice, I'm ready to take it.</p>
<p>I have a Buffalo LinkStation acting as my NAS at the moment, but it's simply serving a USB-attached 320GB Drive.</p>
