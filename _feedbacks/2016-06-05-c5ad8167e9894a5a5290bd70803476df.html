    <b>Comment:</b> Hi there your GPX stripper seems to work OK. I used it on a section of an exported Runkeeper GPX file. However it wouldn't load direct into BaseCamp? I had to load the GPX file into TCX convertor and export it as a standard GPX prior to importing into my Garmin BaseCamp. Any Idea's  I can email you the two files if you like. However thanks for the tool I have added a link to my facebook page @ https://www.facebook.com/Strava.KOM.Hunters<br /><br />
